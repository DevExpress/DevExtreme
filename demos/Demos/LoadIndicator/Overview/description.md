The LoadIndicator component notifies users that a process is in progress. In this demo, you can see how to initialize and configure the component and integrate it into other components.

## Specify Dimensions

LoadIndicator allows you to specify its dimensions. Set the [height](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxLoadIndicator/Configuration/#height) and [width](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxLoadIndicator/Configuration/#width) properties to the size you need. In this demo, the first three components have different sizes.

## Apply a Custom Indicator

If you want to apply a custom indicator, assign the path to a new image to the [indicatorSrc](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxLoadIndicator/Configuration/#indicatorSrc) property. In this demo, the fourth LoadIndicator displays a custom animated GIF.

## Integrate LoadIndicator into Other Components

You can use LoadIndicator within other UI components. In this demo, the indicator appears in the [Button](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxButton/) component when a user clicks the button. To show and hide LoadIndicator, use the [visible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxLoadIndicator/Configuration/#visible) property.
