DevExtreme JavaScript Charting library is a collection of 30+ responsive charts that enable you to transform data into an eye-catching and elegant visual representation. Line, area, bar, pie, funnel, pyramid, financial, range, and polar charts - this is just the tip of the iceberg. Every chart from this library is available as a jQuery plugin, supports binding to any data source, and provides its own distinctive feature set.

Use our DevExpress BI Dashboard to embed interactive business intelligence into your next web app.

The Web Dashboard is a data analysis UI component that you can embed into your ASP.NET Core or Angular, React, and Vue applications with .NET backend. Dashboards allow you to display multiple inter-connected data analysis elements such as grids, charts, maps, gauges, and others: all within an automatically-arranged layout.

The set of components allows you to deploy an all-in-one solution and switch between Viewer and Designer modes directly on the web client (includes adaptive layouts for tablet & mobile).

The Web Dashboard is available as a part of a Universal subscription.
