The Candlestick financial chart is designed to communicate trading patterns over a short period of time. A single data point on a Candlestick [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#type) displays variations in stock prices over the course of a day.

You can use the Candlestick type for an individual [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/) or specify the type in the [commonSeriesSettings](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/) object for all series in the Chart. Use the [commonSeriesSettings](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/).[candlestick](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Series_Types/CandleStickSeries/) object to configure properties of the Chart Candlestick series.

In Candlestick series, each point consists of a rectangle (body) and a vertical line (shadow, wick, or tail). The top and bottom values of a vertical line correspond to the highest and lowest prices of the stock, respectively. Use the [highValueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#highValueField) and [lowValueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#lowValueField) properties to specify data source fields for these prices.

The bottom and topmost values of the point's body correspond to the opening and closing price of a stock. To specify these prices, use the [openValueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#openValueField) and [closeValueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#closeValueField) properties. If the stock closes higher than its opening price, no color fills the body; if the stock closes lower than its opening price, the Chart applies a color fill to the body.

To reflect changes on the market, the Chart component compares the price of every point with the price of the previous point. The Chart paints the points whose price has decreased in a specific [reduction color](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/reduction/#color). To change color of other points, use the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/).[color](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Series_Types/CandleStickSeries/#color) property; you can also specify the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/).[innerColor](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#innerColor) property to fill these points' bodies with color. To switch between high, low, open, or close prices of points as sources for data comparison, use the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/).[reduction](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/reduction/).[level](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/reduction/#level) property.

Apply the following settings to make your chart more user-friendly:

- [tooltip](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/tooltip/).[contentTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/tooltip/#contentTemplate) - specifies a custom tooltip template so you can display additional information, such as price values. 
- [argumentAxis](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/).[workdaysOnly](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/#workdaysOnly) - displays only work days on the argument axis.
