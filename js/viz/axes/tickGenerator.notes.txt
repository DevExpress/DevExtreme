TODO

minor ticks for log (make it denser)

showCalculatedTicks - deprecated in 15.2

remove _correctBusinessRange

smart format for datetime discrete axis (see test 'DateTime axis, no user format, marker visible, discrete axis - format is calculated by ticks')

We use single format for scale markers just to not break 'Saturday, 25' labels format.

+ stick

make option minorGridSpacingFactor

Interval for log axis is calculated wrong
There sre no margins for log axes, for bar series it looks bad. Maybe we can implement margins for log axes

NOTES
gridSpacingFactor shoould be passed to tickGenerator, there is no default value
tickGenerator would not accept gridSpacingFactor <= 0
tickGenerator would not accept tickInterval <= 0

+ showCustomBoundaryTicks, customBoundTicks options in RangeSelector (and internal use in Polar chart) is passed tickManager as addMinMax and tickManager generates boundary ticks
+ This will not be included in tickGenerator and should be processed on Axis level

No margins

setTicksAtUnitBeginning - is not used anymore (17.2)



check

+ percentStick - bounds are not generated if there is percent series and value is abs(1)

+ minSpaceCorrection, maxSpaceCorrection - add one extra tick if there are point labels

+ stick - used in translator, in tick manager it prevents from bounds generating and is used minor ticks generating

checkBoundedTicksOverlapping - ??
getMaxLabelParams - ??

+ minStickValue, maxStickValue - restricts range expansion in tickManager below/above 0. tickGenerator generates ticks based on 0 level, so there is no problem with that


valueType, argumentType, dataType - in RangeSelector and gauges

boundCoef - tickInterval / 2


getCategoriesInfo - can not work with non-unique categories

Problems:
endOnTick + zooming - viewPort and bounds implementation should fix this problem
check axes synchronization

RangeSelector and chart with the same series (especially of bubble type) have different margins (This is correct for 17.1 too)

There is valueMarginsEnabled in rangeSelector's scale. Do we want to document it?




endOnTick - Chart, Polar (argument axis?), RangeSelector, Gauges (bug)
allowDecimals - Chart, Polar (argument axis?), RangeSelector, Gauges
