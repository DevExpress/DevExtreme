    'value': 'CGIAR has a Strategy and Results Framework (SRF) in place for 2016-30, has put in place the first business plan for 2019-21, with plans for three further, three-year business plans up to 2030, and has published a Research Financing Plan (2019-2021 FINPLAN) that brings together, in a single budget, all of the resources for the CGIAR Strategy. The SRF maps out CGIAR’s contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), through addressing five global challenges and clearly sets out CGIAR’s comparative advantage. The business plan further articulates the vision and mission of CGIAR around these contributions and establishes the ongoing reforms that are needed to make CGIAR fit for purpose. The financing plan aims for greater transparency around the allocation of resources and the challenges that CGIAR faces in working towards these longer-term objectives.<br>There are a number of recognised challenges in the implementation of this strategic plan and in the progress towards the achievement of expected results:<br>Work is continuing to clarify the connection between what CGIAR delivers on the ground and the ambitious contribution to the SDGs envisaged. There is further work required to agree on CGIAR’s comparative advantage. The first Performance Report produced for 2017 begins to set out what CGIAR has been able to achieve, with a recognition that more work is needed on the evidence base to continue to build confidence in achievements.<br>Further work is underway and is required to make CGIAR an effective and focused system. While significant progress has been made in reforming CGIAR over the last decade, the first business plan highlights the future challenges of continued reform. Change continues, although there is some frustration among stakeholders both with the complex nature of decision-making in the partnership and with the pace of this change.<br>Funding remains an issue where there is a need for a clear shared vision between CGIAR and its Funders. CGIAR has had to work hard to manage a complex and changing funding situation and has recently put in place online systems to increase the transparency of its finances. While there was initial optimism on the part of CGIAR for obtaining longer-term financial support and while the funding situation has stabilised over the last two to three years, there is still a need for a greater range of Funders to recognise the need for longer-term and more consistent funding of CGIAR as a whole.',

The Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MLF) is the financial mechanism for the Montreal Protocol (MP) and is mandated to provide financing for the incremental costs of the phase-out of nearly 100 substances controlled by the MP. The Control Schedule for these substances provides an extremely clear long-term, time-bound vision and intended results for the MLF, which the Fund and its four implementing agencies operationalise through three-year rolling business plans. The MLF is the sole international financial mechanism for the phase-out of ozone depleting substances and for the phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) under the Kigali Amendment.<br>The organisational architecture of the MLF was established under the MP in order to assist Article 5 countries (recipients) to comply with the terms of the Protocol. The Fund is not a programme but a financial mechanism under the authority of the Meeting of the Parties to the MP with the programmatic responsibility entrusted to the Executive Committee (EXCOM). Its programmes are carried out through four implementing agencies – the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the World Bank – and a few bilateral agencies. As structured, it is fully congruent with a clear long-term vision and associated operating model.<br>The MP is an international normative agreement in its own right, and the MLF is mandated solely to provide financing for Article 5 countries under this agreement. The extent to which the strategic plan of the MLF supports wider normative frameworks is therefore considered to be non-applicable for this assessment.<br>The MLF is replenished every three years by the Parties to the MP. Financial and budgetary planning under the Montreal Protocol is based on a three-year rolling business plan approved by the EXCOM. Virtually all funding is non-earmarked. The financial framework is regularly reviewed by the EXCOM and by the Parties in order to ensure that it provides appropriate and effective support to compliance under the terms of the MP.',

    'value': 'UNCTAD’s long-term vision is laid out in its mandate, which is updated during quadrennial conferences, most recently with the UNCTAD XIV Nairobi Maafikiano outcome document. Through these, member states task the UNCTAD secretariat to operate across a vast and growing set of ambitious trade and development challenges. UNCTAD fulfils its mandate through three closely interlinked functions or pillars, covering four broad cross-cutting themes and five subprogrammes and building on six geographical priority principles. The Maafikiano – similar to previous outcome documents – identifies no less than 110 priorities.<br>Technical co-operation (TC) is one of UNCTAD’s three pillars. Due to a lack of consensus among member states, the last secretariat-wide strategy on TC was adopted in 2003 and consists of guiding principles. It has not been updated to align with outcome documents. The Maafikiano provides policy overview but not a clearly defined strategy on TC operationalising the mandate in terms of intended results. At UNCTAD, TC is de facto decentralised; the five divisional directors maintain a high level of autonomy with respect to the way they strategise, operationalise, process and organise TC. Consequently, different operating models have evolved over time and co-exist alongside each other, with Technical Cooperation Section (TCS) of the Office of the Secretary-General (OSG) more in an enabling than a steering capacity. Inter-divisional co-operation is a persistent challenge within the secretariat. While OSG’s incremental efforts to promote interdivisional collaboration are noteworthy, in practice, much still depends on the personal networks and initiative of staff members.<br>The degree to which UNCTAD engages in strong co-operation with other agencies varies considerably, again depending on how each division, branch, section and individual staff member approach this. As a non-resident agency, UNCTAD acknowledges the need for strong co-operation with other agencies. It aligns its TC to relevant wider normative frameworks pertinent to its mandate, including inter alia the Agenda 2030 and the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development and the Vienna Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade 2014–2024; and the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (Samoa Pathway). UNCTAD leads the UN Inter-Agency Cluster on Trade and Productive Capacity. TC projects and programmes support and strengthen national policy frameworks that incorporate normative frameworks. Despite limited staff capacity, the secretariat engages in 37 UNDAFs (now known as UNSDCFs). UNCTAD reports annually to member states on expenditures against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).<br>At UNCTAD, member states play a key role in determining work plans. Neither member states nor the secretariat have set clear, strategic priorities between UNCTAD’s three pillars, or within the TC pillar. UNCTAD faces mounting pressure to deliver more results with less resources. Demand for its TC is growing, often as the result of engagement in the context of UNTAD’s consensus-building pillar and research and analysis pillar. Consequently, although budgets are adequately prepared and planned, in practice, resources are spread too thinly across a growing number of workstreams. Accordingly, the TC pillar suffers from resource shortages as well as competing priorities. While ideally demand-driven, in practice, TC relies heavily on earmarked donor funding in accordance with donor priorities.<br>UNCTAD lacks a secretariat-wide fundraising strategy; previous attempts to address this were not met with consensus among member states. TC is highly fragmented. It is grouped into 28 “products” and is largely funded through extrabudgetary (XB) sources (90.4%). Projects are (partially) self-financed or externally funded. XB funding has been erratic. The two main programmes, ASYCUDA and DMFAS, account for 58% of the expenses, and slightly less than half of the projects. Generally speaking, projects are small in size, with a short lifespan. In December 2018, over 80 sources of funding (USD 34 million) contributed to no less than 249 projects in over a hundred countries.',

The MTPF 2018-21 currently addresses the global mandate of Agenda 2030 and other changes in the global development landscape. It provides strategic guidance for UNIDO to achieve its mandate of supporting countries to achieve inclusive and sustainable industrial development. The MTPF is supported by an integrated results and performance framework (IRPF). The IRPF provides clarity on the Organisation’s expected contribution to global development results, in particular for achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9. Results chains and responsibilities for results are not clear.<br>The organisational architecture is increasingly congruent with the MTPF, but there remain some gaps in alignment. UNIDO is taking steps to address these gaps, as evident in recent promulgation of policies intended to provide a coherent, strategic approach and vision to deliver the organisation’s strategic objectives and in revision of the IRPF and theory of change to ensure it is better aligned to the MTPF. UNIDO’s internal operating model is highly centralised, and the field is not always well integrated with headquarters (HQ) in all cases. UNIDO does not always strike a clear balance between its role as a normative organisation and as a development organisation. While norms and standards feature among the four functions, reference to critical sector-specific normative frameworks are mostly lacking, e.g. International Labour Organization (ILO) core labour standards or United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) conventions. <br>UNIDO is largely supported through voluntary contributions, and most funding is earmarked. This presents an ongoing challenge to the organisation which has also lost some member states in recent years and seen consequent decreases to the regular budget. Dependence on earmarked contributions constrains the organisation’s independence in pursuing its strategic aims and implementing the MTPF, as well as aligning activities to country priorities and results.',

There does not appear to be a strong, clear and unifying long-term vision that drives the Office – and that is articulated publicly. <br>UNODC’s organisational architecture is only partially congruent with the strategic plan. The operating model appears to support the implementation of the strategic plan to a limited extent. This is one of UNODC’s fundamental challenges, of which it is keenly aware. UNODC’s operating model is a function of its financial framework. UNODC is overwhelmingly reliant on tightly earmarked, often short-term donor contributions. Its ability to deliver value to beneficiaries is driven by what its donors are willing to finance. UNODC is keenly aware of this consequence, noting that its financial framework hinders its ability to deliver its mandate effectively.<br>The strategic plan is aligned to wider normative frameworks. The activities of UNODC are grounded in a series of international instruments for which the Office acts as “guardian and advocate”. They include the three international drug control conventions, the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) and its protocols, the international legal instruments against terrorism, and the UN Standards and Norms in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. In addition to its foundational mandates, UNODC sees itself as responsible for supporting the delivery of certain SDGs and a series of UN agreements. <br>UNODC has very limited ability to ensure that all priority areas have adequate funding. Its ability to do this is restricted by its lack of access to flexible finance. The volume of core resources UNODC receives is insufficient to finance functions that in other institutions would be considered integral (e.g. evaluation, gender, results management systems). UNODC must rely on special purpose funds – earmarked donor funds – to finance these functions. Most of its normative work is also financed from earmarked funds.',

    'value': 'MI 1.1 Analysis<br>UNCTAD was established to promote an inclusive global economy, through informing national and international policies, while giving priority consideration for the needs and interests of developing countries.<br>UNCTAD’s strategic priorities are determined by member states and reflected in the quadrennial conference outcome documents, including the Accra Accord (2008), the Doha Mandate (2012) and most recently the Nairobi Maafikiano (2016). The Nairobi Maafikiano is the outcome document of the 14th session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 2016 and frames the agenda for UNCTAD work over a four-year period until 2020. It sets out a work programme that builds on the Doha Mandate and updates the thematic and priority areas of UNCTAD’s work.<br>These quadrennial outcome documents direct UNCTAD’s TC to work on a vast number of thematic priorities, across a large geographic scope. In the Maafikiano, in keeping with previous outcome documents, member states call on UNCTAD to concentrate on four broad cross-cutting themes, while also contributing to the implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of relevant global conferences. At the same time, it should also strengthen its role as focal point within the UN for the integrated treatment of trade and development in the areas of finance, technology, investment and sustainable development. Geographically, it should focus on the least developed countries (LDCs), Africa, landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing states (SIDSs), and other vulnerable and small economies, while also giving attention to the needs of middle-income countries. Altogether, this amounts to 110 priorities. <br>There are five subprogrammes: (i) Globalisation and Development Strategies; (ii) Investment and Enterprise; (iii) International Trade and Commodities; (iv) Technology and Logistics; and (5) Africa, Least Developed Countries and Special Programmes. Each subprogramme is led by a division within the secretariat. For each subprogramme, the strategic framework outlines a general strategy to achieve the subprogramme’s objectives. These strategies do not specify actions for TC.<br>The most recent secretariat-wide TC strategy of UNCTAD was adopted in 2003 and is annexed to the Trade and Development Board’s decision 478 (L) of October 2003. The strategy sets the scope, guiding principles and objectives of UNCTAD TC activities. Six key principles characterise the 2003 strategy:<br>focus on long-term, sustainable capacity development<br>strengthened links between analytical work and TC activities<br>emphasis on ownership by beneficiaries and demand-driven operations<br>priority for activities in favour of LDCs and countries with particular needs and weaknesses<br>(increased co-operation with other international organisations<br>strengthened governance and co-ordination, including improved monitoring and evaluation    of projects.<br>UNCTAD’s TC should be demand-driven; embracing country ownership; based on principles of transparency, efficiency, effectiveness and accountability; and implemented in a geographically balanced manner; with priority given to LDCs, LLDCs, SIDSs and fragile and conflict-affected states (FCASs). Since 2003, these principles have been consistently reiterated and have driven the composition of UNCTAD’s TC portfolio.<br>The Working Party on the Strategic Framework and the Programme Budget is the mechanism for consultations among member states on all issues regarding TC and for interactive debate among the secretariat, potential beneficiaries and donors. It meets every year in September to discuss TC matters and submits a draft decision for adoption by the Trade and Development Board. The deliberations of the Working Party are based on information prepared by the secretariat every year and contained in three documents: (i) the review of the TC activities of UNCTAD; (ii) summary of activities undertaken in a given year and (iii) statistical tables.<br>Since 2003, the TC strategy has not been updated to ensure consistency with policy developments within UNCTAD. While the strategic priorities for the organisation are set every four years by the outcome document of the quadrennial ministerial conference, neither member states nor the secretariat’s management have set clear, strategic priorities between UNCTAD’s three pillars, nor have they articulated a regularly updated and aligned TC strategy.<br>The 2003 strategy does not contain a clearly articulated and operationalised long-term vision, nor does it articulate or operationalise UNCTAD’s comparative advantages, also in light of the ongoing UN reform. It was not until September 2019, at the 78th Session of the Working Party, in consideration of the ongoing UN development system reform, that member states charged UNCTAD’s secretariat with developing a new TC strategy for presentation in early 2020.<br>Consequently, set against the elements’ benchmarks, the MI is assessed as unsatisfactory.',

    'value': 'The 2018-21 MTPF, which is publicly available, provides strategic guidance for UNIDO to implement its mandate of supporting countries to achieve inclusive and sustainable industrial development. The long-term vision of UNIDO, as reflected in the MTPF, is “the eradication of poverty through inclusive and sustainable industrial development” (1) (ISID). It is based on the 2013 Lima Declaration and specifically SDG 9 to “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation” (1). UNIDO’s programmatic focus, as per the MTPF, is structured around four strategic priorities: <br>• advancing economic competitiveness<br>• creating shared prosperity<br>• safeguarding the environment<br>• strengthening knowledge and institutions. <br><br>UNIDO’s vision is based on recognition of the organisation’s comparative advantage in industrial development, being the only international organisation mandated to support countries in pursuing ISID and SDG 9. Other strengths that contribute to UNIDO’s comparative advantage are that it: <br>• is one of the leading United Nations (UN) agencies working with the business sector <br>• has experience working to address global environmental challenges <br>• has a convening role for different stakeholders.<br><br>Interviewees at HQ were of the view that UNIDO’s comparative advantage included a good understanding of the issues in industry and the ability to propose the right solutions based on industrial culture which makes them “unique”. Staff were not always clear about who they are targeting and who their ultimate beneficiaries are; however, these are generally recognised as being governments. The Director General (DG) broadcasts management priorities at the beginning of each year. There are currently (2019) three – upscaling technical assistance services (including the Programmes for Country Partnership, PCP), driving operational efficiency and developing innovative partnerships. <br>The MTPF 2018-21 operationalises UNIDO’s vision; an integrated results and performance framework (IRPF) consisting of two tiers (development and organisational performance respectively) is included in the MTPF 2018-21 which defines the organisation’s intended results at both programmatic and management levels. This was updated in May 2019; indicators were fine-tuned and adapted to ensure the telling of an evidence-based performance story “connecting key elements of UNIDO’s strategy and capturing of SDG indicators” (9). Interviewees suggested that “[t]he IRPF makes sense at organisational and high levels now”. The four levels of the IRPF (as per the 2019 revision) are:<br>• industrial development context<br>• country and global results with UNIDO support<br>• programme offer and programme management effectiveness<br>• organisational resources and efficiency.<br><br>The 2019 IRPF contains a much clearer theory of change than the previous iteration and considers external factors that will influence the organisation’s pathway towards ISID as well as contextual issues such as UN reform. A new policy published in May 2019, entitled “Overarching Policy on the Management for Scale up and Integration of Results”, complements a suite of six other new documents providing a more coherent and strategic approach and vision to deliver UNIDO’s strategic objectives.<br>To ensure relevance, the MTPF is reviewed and revised; an earlier version of the MTPF (2016-19) was revised in 2017 to create the current 2018-21 version. Following this, a mid-term review of the MTPF 2018-21 was conducted in 2019, which interviews suggested was an “inclusive process” involving questionnaires and interviews with staff. It was the first mid-term review of an MTPF and called “an update of the MTPF” rather than a conventional review.',

    'value': 'UNODC’s Proposed programme budget for the 2018-19 biennium contains a mission statement, namely: to “contribute to the achievement of security and justice for all by making the world safer from drugs, crime and terrorism” (4/69). UNODC’s strategic documents do not articulate a more detailed long-term vision except insofar as they refer to the Office’s role in supporting the achievement of a series of international instruments for which the Office acts as “guardian and advocate”, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a number of UN resolutions. There does not appear to be a strong, clear and unifying long-term vision that drives the Office – and that is articulated publicly. The strategy framework mirrors the budget reporting cycle and is refreshed every two years. There is thus no longer-term vision that drives or underpins UNODC’s programme budget. Interviews with UNODC’s stakeholders and staff indicated that there is a strong appetite for a current and clear strategic vision across the Office – a high-level, long-term vision as well as a vision on more specific areas such as how the Office will align itself with a reforming UN system. <br>UNODC’s vision, as it stands, is in line with its comparative advantage, which in turn is identified from the mandates given to it by the UN. Its mandate derives from a series of international instruments for which the Office acts as “guardian and advocate”. They include the three international drug control conventions, the UNCAC, the UNTOC and its protocols, the international legal instruments against terrorism, and the UN Standards and Norms in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. The broad areas of UNODC’s mandate are clear and relatively uncontested within and outside the UN family – there are few areas of overlap with other multilateral organisations. However, as several interviewees noted, UNODC has not yet articulated strategically which elements of these very broad conventions and other standards it will prioritise, or how it will support them. This is an area that several interlocutors consider a significant gap in UNODC’s strategic outlook. <br>UNODC does have strategic-level documents that aim to operationalise its mandate and that seek to set out to define intended results. UNODC’s strategic planning is encapsulated in two documents: its biennial strategic framework and its budget. Both seek to operationalise its mandate and define the intended results to which the organisation contributes. As UNODC is an Office of the UN Secretariat, its 2018-19 strategic framework is embedded within the General Assembly’s overall “biennial plan and priorities”, currently listed as Programme 13. Its strategic framework identifies nine subprogrammes. Each has an objective followed by an “expected accomplishment of the Secretariat” with “indicators of achievement” – i.e. the intended results. UNODC’s strategic plan then includes an outline of its strategy to implement each subprogramme. <br>UNODC has six thematic subprogrammes:<br>1. Countering transnational organized crime<br>2. A comprehensive and balanced approach to counter the world drug problem<br>3. Countering corruption<br>4. Terrorism prevention<br>5. Justice<br>6. Research, trend analysis and forensics<br>And three cross-cutting subprogrammes that provide services to member states:<br>1. Policy support<br>2. Technical co-operation and field support<br>3. Provision of secretariat services and substantive support to the United Nations intergovernmental bodies, the International Narcotics Control Board and the United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.<br><br>UNODC’s Programme and Budget for 2018-19 seeks to operationalise the strategic plan by allocating funding and staff resources to each of the subprogrammes. It further identifies the expected accomplishments of the Secretariat, indicators of achievement and the biannual performance measures as well as outputs. However, the “expected accomplishments” and “indicators of achievement” – or results – tend to be at the level of outputs rather than outcomes. <br>The strategic plan is renewed and reviewed by UNODC’s governing bodies every two years, and the Programme and Budget is produced every two years as well. Beginning in 2020 and on a trial basis, the Programme and Budget will be reviewed on an annual basis. Unless UNODC is able to develop a longer-term strategic vision, this change may encourage UNODC to focus on what can be achieved in an even shorter timeframe (one rather than two years) – encouraging an operational rather than strategic focus. UNODC will continue with the current biennial cycle for its consolidated budget. UNODC’s plans do reflect new priorities that are substantive challenges in UNODC’s area of competence. However, reviews do not appear to have reflected on the need for a clearer vision and do not present a strategic response to UNODC’s strategic challenges: to a large extent, it is dependent on direction from the provision of donor finance, as outlined below.<br>There is tension within UNODC relating to its strategic direction. On the one hand, some consider that UNODC is not a development agency. This view holds that UNODC works to a security and justice mandate that creates the conditions for development but that it is not a development agency or organisation itself. Those that hold this view cite the recent decision not to charge the 1% levy on UNODC’s budget as a contribution to the UN Resident Coordinator System. Certain donors also hold this view – with some representing member states’ law enforcement agencies. On the other hand, several interviewees consider that, given the Secretary-General’s recent directive for the UN family to be “people-centred” and given the focus of the SDGs, UNODC’s core mandate is fundamentally about making a contribution to development. <br>The conventions and protocols for which UNODC is a guardian, while giving primacy to criminal-justice and law-enforcement perspectives, also call for a people-centred approach in some areas, and UNODC clearly takes a people-centred, developmental approach in several fields of competence. But interviews indicate that there were, at the time of the assessment, differences of opinion on the direction UNODC should take. For example, some staff within UNODC who considered that UNODC needs to become more people-centred thought it should re-orientate resources from headquarters to the field to better focus on beneficiaries. In specific areas of competence, interviewees reflected that a stronger people-centred approach would result in UNODC doing more to support victims of terrorism, as well as prevention and investigation; victims of human trafficking, in addition to tackling traffickers; drug users, to reduce harm, as well as focus on prevention.<br>The tension between these views of UNODC’s strategic direction has yet to be resolved. There is a need for a leadership decision on its vision and strategic direction in the light of the Secretary-General’s position.',

    'value': 'Although the most recent Programme Budget 2020-21, as a transitional budget, sets out the intent to align resources to results, there is still a gap between ambition and practice. The 2018 External Auditor’s Report found that there is a lack of clarity on what the intended results are, on what UNIDO is accountable for and on the linkage between the key corporate documents. With the advent of the revised 2019 IRPF, which specifies results more clearly and will require projects and the organisation as a whole to report to these indicators, it should become possible in time to link budgets and costings to results.<br>The Programme and Budget (P&B) 2020-21 provides costings for each major programme. Major Programme C “Thematic Programme Framework towards ISID” is broken down into the high level ISID goals but not into specific results from the IRPF. The 2020-21 budget identifies the outcomes for each element of Programme C and the results anticipated from each, but these are not yet linked to resources. There are no results identified at present for non-project-based activities, and so these are not currently subject to results-based assessment, costings or reporting.<br>Currently there is no tracking of costs from activity through to results. The 2018 External Auditor’s Report observed, “[W]e determined that while the P&B’s major programmes, programmes and sub-programmes identified the objectives and expected results, these were neither from the MTPF nor the IRPF. The P&B was only linked with the IRPF through the indicators in both documents but not on the objectives and expected results in the P&B” (13). The ERP has the capacity to allow reporting on results and activities as well as finance and expenditure, but this has not been done to date. <br>Within the ERP, there has been a heavy emphasis on financial data, required for donor reporting, rather than on results data which has not been well specified or aligned with an RBM framework. Less attention has been paid to the quality of data, and it has not been widely used, so there has been little incentive to improve data quality. A further challenge is that UNIDO’s heavy focus on projects means that there is no comparable financial or results reporting for non-project activities. With the introduction of the 2019 IRPF, there is an evident intent to minimise the use of unsynchronised indicators, which has impeded their aggregation. <br>UNIDO has recently taken steps to develop the budgeting system to ensure the 2022-23 budget cycle is fully results-driven and can provide costing for results, thus providing effective implementation and support to IRPF and MTPF. The implementation of simplified time recording and introduction of Full Cost Recovery costing mechanisms in the ERP system also commenced in 2019. A Taskforce on Full Cost Recovery was established in 2018. One of the objectives of the task force is to trace and record costs spent per result to enhance budget processes for regular budget as well as technical co-operation activities.',

    'value': 'UNODC’s recent organisational budget – and its composite budgets – align financial resources with strategic objectives and intended results of the current strategic plan. The biennium 2018-19 consolidated budget and the 2018-19 programme budget align financing with objectives for the biennium: the objective, expected “accomplishments”, and indicators of achievement are identified along with the resources allocated (disaggregated by source). The internal instructions for preparing these budgets give instructions to staff on how to ensure the budgets follow the results-based approach. <br>UNODC’s budget document does provide clear costings for the achievement of each management result. In the consolidated budget for the biennium 2018-19, a budget table lists the distribution of resources by components. Another budget table shows requirements by component broken down by programme of work. A third shows costings for objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and performance measures.<br>Systems are available to track costs from activity to result at a relatively high level. At programme level, managers use workplans (normally costed by activity) to monitor implementation in quantitative and qualitative terms. These are not online and make office-wide analysis complex: at present, Umoja lacks modules to track programme management. Umoja Extension 2 will introduce this facility when it is rolled out. To close this gap, the Regional Office for Southeast Asia and the Pacific and Afghanistan and Pakistan country offices developed their own online smart sheets. <br>They use this online monitoring tool to track and monitor implementation data, related SDGs and relevant regional initiatives, including activity status, delivery date, number of participants (male/female) and beneficiaries. These programmes can track costs at a higher level of detail. <br>There is evidence that UNODC’s costing of management and development results has improved over time. The assessment team saw evidence that UNODC is reviewing and revising its costing of standard budget input – helping to improve the accuracy of budgets. UNODC’s introduction of the full cost recovery model – and the need to accurately calculate direct and indirect costs – in the 2014-15 consolidated budget drove its ability to cost inputs more accurately. <br>UNODC’s consolidated budget for the 2008-09 biennium was its first results-based budget, and it harmonised UNODC budget terminology with that of the UN Secretariat. The General Assembly’s Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions report on the consolidated budget for the biennium 2012-13, noted that improvements had been made to the results-based format but that there was scope for further refinement of the results-based framework, particularly in terms of strengthening the relationship between indicators of achievement and the relevant performance measures. Some progress has been made in improving them. UNODC restructured its programme into nine subprogrammes in the 2014-15 biennium partly to strengthen results-based management. In the proposed 2020 budget, variances between 2019 and 2020 estimates are explained.',

However, no internal audits of the Secretariat were conducted during the assessment period. The last audit of the Secretariat was conducted on the retirement of the previous Chief Officer in August 2013. In conducting its work, the Internal Audit Division is guided by the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing promulgated by the Institute of Internal Auditors. OIOS reports are publicly available on the OIOS website. <br>Previous MOPAN assessments for UNDP, UNEP and the World Bank rated these IAs as highly satisfactory against this MI.

As a member of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG), it contributes to the full implementation of evaluation norms and standards.<br>At the organisational level, UNCTAD is subject to a robust system of internal and external oversight, including external audits by the UN Board of Auditors (BoA), an audit body composed of three supreme national audit bodies on a rotational basis that exercises external audit mainly of a financial nature. UNCTAD’s internal audits are conducted by the OIOS and the Internal Audit Division, which provides the functions of audit and carries out audits in accordance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. Audits by OIOS are conducted independently of UNCTAD, though within the UN system they are considered to be internal audits. OIOS undertakes two to three audits a year, based on its own risk assessment. Since November 2013, OIOS has completed nine internal audits of UNCTAD, though these have a broader focus than TC. OIOS has only completed two external evaluations of UNCTAD in the same time period, a programme evaluation of the research and analysis pillar in 2015 and the follow-up review in 2018.<br>JIU is the only independent external oversight body of the UN system and the only entity mandated with conducting inspections, evaluations and investigations system-wide. JIU conducted its most recent UNCTAD-specific review of the management and organisation in 2012. UNCTAD’s management response is publicly available as a report to the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board. JUI also engages with UNCTAD when evaluating system-wide thematic issues. Given the broad-scale nature of the reports and recommendations, there is not a direct management response from UNCTAD to these.<br>There is a progress tracking system for OIOS recommendations and JUI recommendations within the MIS dashboard.

Interviews suggest that joint progress assessments of TC do occur, though not in all cases.

    'value': 'At country level, the project steering committee assesses progress of interventions on a regular basis, usually every six months. Such steering committees consist of line ministries; national and local stakeholders; UNIDO; other relevant UN agencies/IFIs; relevant business representatives; and in some cases donors. Project managers report against the log-frame and also report on budgets, changes and any issues requiring agreement to an adjustment of the project. Countries with country programmes have national steering committees with a similar set of partners to review progress on the country programme. Interviewees noted that not all project managers engage stakeholders well in mutual assessments and feedback. The survey findings indicate lower levels of satisfaction with mutual assessments, one part of synergies with partners.<br>Within PCPs, there is a national multi-sectoral body tasked with co-ordination and review. For instance in Ethiopia, the National Technical Task Force (made up of national bodies) is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the PCP, including reviewing implementation status and challenges, recommending mitigation measures, monitoring progress and reporting on it annually. A UNIDO PCP programme manager is responsible for overseeing and drawing together monitoring information and the progress report for PCPs. At the end of the first phase of the PCP, there is a joint review to take stock of PCP accomplishments and measure the results and contribution to impact of the PCP programme on specific industrial sectors/areas and its contributions to the achievement of ISID and the SDGs, as well as to validate the way forward for the country’s industrial development. The contribution of UNIDO is specified in terms of UNIDO project implementation progress and expenditure.<br>PCP programme managers present and discuss findings of the mid-term PCP review with the National Coordination Body and other national stakeholders, and recommendations are agreed and formalised by the body. The UNIDO Evaluation Office finalises evaluation reports for projects and country programmes and shares the latter with internal and external stakeholders, including the relevant management response sheet. The mechanism by which this is agreed by all partners is not clearly specified, and there are no joint assessment reports.<br>Interviewees cautioned that some projects do not engage stakeholders well in mutual assessments and feedback on projects and in agreeing changes to projects. <br>The UNIDO evaluation manual and TOR for mid-term reviews both require an assessment of partner and stakeholder/beneficiary perceptions to be undertaken.

    'value': 'UNODC has a mandate to lead in the assessment of globally agreed drug and crime conventions. Therefore, participation with partners in assessments of progress in implementing agreed commitments is one of its key functions. There is a great deal of evidence from the different sectors that headquarters-based sectors, regional offices and global programmes lead or participate in multi-stakeholder dialogue at the global, regional and national levels. UNODC is also involved at the country level in mutual assessments in its areas of competence – using its influence to encourage partner governments to improve its performance. It also takes part in UN Country Team planning, monitoring and evaluation.<br>UNODC participates in multi-stakeholder dialogue around joint sectoral or normative commitments in all the sectors and with respect to its strategic objectives. Participating and convening are one of UNODC’s core functions, and there is strong and consistent evidence that it does this with respect to its strategic objectives. It also leads the process of joint performance reviews on normative standards in relation to both the drug and crime conventions it safeguards. For example, the December 2017 resolution and decisions of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption represents the culmination of a review process that is multi-stakeholder.<br>There is particularly strong evidence of UNODC participation in joint sectoral and normative commitments in relation to drugs and crime. To give just two examples, UNODC has operated in partnership with the World Bank in the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative since 2007 and in 2017 supported the organisation of the first Global Forum on Asset Recovery (GFAR) where representatives from 26 jurisdictions, international organisations and civil society created the basis for stronger global asset recovery. This forum established a basis for learning and stronger practice – facilitating the return of USD 321 million. UNODC also engages in the UNAIDS Joint Programme and is the technical and convening agency on HIV/AIDS and people who use drugs and on HIV/AIDS in prisons on an ongoing basis. <br>At the country level, UNODC participates as a member of UN Country Teams in joint analytical work – principally the mandatory Common Country Assessment as part of the UNDAF development: it also joins in multi-stakeholder dialogue during the strategic prioritisation phase of the UNDAF and in common UN system monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of UNDAF and associated workplan results. In addition, it has participated in UNDAFs where it does not have a permanent country representative.<br>UNODC contributes to or is the lead author of joint progress statements or status reports in a broad range of issues – set out below in MI 6.9. UNODC’s contribution is evidenced by reports and its own reporting. Most of its flagship reports and the reports undertaken by programmes are the result of collaboration. Specifically, UNODC is a co-facilitator, alongside UNDP, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, and UNHCR, on the Global Alliance for Reporting Progress on Promoting Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies. <br>These reports present assessments of progress made by its partners and stakeholders that relate to UNODC’s mandate at the global level and indicate its influencing. <br>Documentation from mutual progress assessments contains a clear statement of UNODC’s contribution and is agreed by partners.<br>Some UNODC programmes do use surveys and other means of obtaining partner perceptions of progress. UNODC’s collaborative work with partners and stakeholders is evident in the management of most of its programmes. UNODC makes extensive use of surveys as a tool to help counterparts identify progress. For example, together with WHO, UNODC developed a drug treatment survey to help national counterparts plan and monitor the impact of treatment systems it helped develop. A 2018 audit recommended that one of UNODC’s programmes could better capture beneficiary feedback and use it to design programme revisions.',

    'value': 'The CGIAR website has a clear statement on the importance of knowledge production, under the heading of Open Access and Open Data: CGIAR Research Centers and Research Programs have been leaders in agricultural development for decades, producing valuable outputs that are generally considered to be global public goods.” In the preamble to CGIAR’s Open Access and Data Management Policy, its role in knowledge production is set out as follows: “CGIAR regards the results of its research and development activities as international public goods and is committed to their widespread dissemination and use to achieve the maximum impact to advantage the poor, especially smallholder farmers in developing countries.” <br>There is considerable evidence in the 2017 Performance Report that CGIAR’s research results have contributed to national- and international-level policies. There are also specific examples, such as in the FTA Annual Report, that knowledge products have been used by partners to inform advocacy at national and regional levels. There is some evidence from interviews that knowledge products are timely.<br>On the production of knowledge products, The Synthesis and Lessons Learned from 15 CRP Evaluations includes this conclusion: “Overall, the evaluations concluded that the CRPs have been able to produce outputs of a quality that is consistent with what can be expected from international agricultural research Organisations.” However, there is considerable variability in this respect. Over 75% of survey respondents rated CGIAR’s knowledge products as excellent or very good. <br>The evidence available shows that the main knowledge products have in the main been peer-reviewed articles, which can have limited reach, as is recognised in CGIAR. As a result, efforts are being made to extend the reach of CGIAR’s work, through a greater range of knowledge products.',

Within two years of the entry into force of this Protocol and every two years thereafter, each Party is required to submit to the Secretariat a summary of the activities it has conducted pursuant to this Article. Opportunities for knowledge production are discussed at Executive Committee meetings; “the Executive Committee has recently decided:<br>(a) to request that the Secretariat continue to make available through the Multilateral Fund website the outcome of the demonstration projects implemented to date<br>(b) to further share the results of the demonstration projects through dedicated communication products such as project fact sheets (MLF, 2018, Report of the 81st Meeting of the Executive Committee).<br>Regional networks and workshops are used as a tool for sharing knowledge: “The Executive Committee agreed that, given the opportunities provided through the regional networks, other regional and national training workshops, the process of country programme preparation and institutional strengthening activities, there should normally not be a need for regional workshops specifically on data collection and reporting. It further agreed that, on the understanding that there were no financial implications for the Fund in such a project, UNEP should be invited to proceed with the preparation of a manual on data collection” (MLF, 2017, Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria. 9. Project Proposals). HQ interviews described how a major role of the MLF in knowledge management is the experience it gains from reviewing all projects under the Montreal Protocol and sharing this learning with IAs and NOUs.<br>An information strategy for the MLF was produced in 2003. HQ staff described how the MLF website provides a “wealth of information”, how reporting is generated after each meeting of the Executive Committee (to be shared with all parties) and how the MLF produces a colloquial report which it provides to UNEP – which then distributes it to all countries. HQ interviews suggested that the unique role of the MLF in knowledge production is supporting demonstration projects for new technologies and generating factsheets on the results. Guides produced by the Secretariat are also knowledge products.<br>Within the MLF, it is principally the role of UNEP to produce knowledge products and assess their utility. UNEP has a clearinghouse function under the Montreal Protocol and occasionally produces knowledge products for technicians involved in the phase-out of ODS, as well as for other audiences. UNEP has produced many products over the years for a wide range of stakeholders.<br>The document review found no evidence regarding how MLF knowledge products have been used by partners to inform action.<br>The document review found no evidence regarding whether MLF knowledge products have been applied to inform advocacy at country, regional or global level.<br>The document review found no evidence regarding whether knowledge products have been perceived as timely by partners.<br>The document review found no evidence regarding whether knowledge products have been perceived as high quality by partners.',

    'value': 'Seen from an organisational level, “knowledge products” include research and flagship reports, which trigger demand for and help inform design and implementation of TC projects. Seen from a purely TC perspective, knowledge products include items from the UNCTAD Toolbox such as Investment Policy Reviews, Trade Policy Framework Reviews and any other knowledge products that are generated by a project. For example, the diagnostic trade integration study with regard to the Djibouti–Ethiopia corridor led by ALDC was one of the major provisions of TC in the undertaking of the project. Ethiopia had used the diagnostic trade integration study to mainstream trade into its five-year national plan. In addition, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation had used this study to develop its programme for country partnership in Ethiopia, and the World Bank had referred to the study for policy formulations in Ethiopia.<br>Evaluations point to the interconnectivity between knowledge products generated in the research and analysis pillar and in TC: “Subprogramme 5 is essentially following a ripple-effect strategy whereby research, which lies at the core of the strategy, is used as the impact that generates waves, creating awareness for change, which in turn lead to demand for TC and, together, research and TC lead to debates, to the evolution of new norms and new consensus and to new policies.”<br>Member states participating in the partner survey show high levels of appreciation for UNCTAD’s knowledge products, with over 90% of respondents stating that they are (very) useful to their work.',

The MTPF 2018-21 emphasises UNIDO’s plan to increase its focus on analytic and statistical work to better support countries in their efforts towards achieving ISID and the SDGs. These activities include those in the appraisal phase of large projects or programmes, including the PCPs, which require country and sector-specific ISID analysis, co-ordination work, institutional support, and, where necessary, capacity building services. This approach is further built on by the 2019 IRPF which states that a fundamental area of influence of UNIDO’s efforts is the generation of increased knowledge and understanding of ISID issues.<br>UNIDO has the mandate to collect and produce global industrial statistics. UNIDO’s Policy, Research and Statistics Department is responsible for producing a range of well-respected knowledge products, which are widely used by governments and by research institutions to inform analysis and policy. The Industrial Development Report (IDR) is the periodical flagship publication of UNIDO. It is complemented by relevant working papers and studies published on the UNIDO website, for example on women’s participation, industrialisation in Africa and least developed countries, migration, and globalisation. UNIDO also maintains and manages five global databases comprising statistics on overall industrial growth, detailed data on business structure and statistics on major indicators of industrial performance by country in a historical time series. Data from these are used by governments and economists in assessing industrial performance and for monitoring six SDG 9 indicators.<br>UNIDO convenes global and regional fora and is part of various networks and platforms which serve as means of sharing best practices and innovative solutions in the field of ISID. These are well attended and provide an opportunity for UNIDO to influence thinking through its studies and experience from country level work and research briefs. UNIDO participates in global fora on industrial statistics and SDG indicators. Statistical country briefs are produced to support country ISID and policy development. At country level, workshops and conferences are used by URs/UCRs to share knowledge on technology and industrialisation, bringing in experts as necessary. Some URs/UCRs who have technical backgrounds have the requisite technical knowledge to do this themselves and support advocacy at country level, but not all URs/UCRs have the necessary skills for advocacy and influencing thinking. The MOPAN partner survey found that partners working for Cambodia and Senegal (both PCP countries) tend to assign higher ratings in the survey for quality of inputs to policy dialogue.<br>UNIDO supports South-South and triangular industrial co-operation for knowledge and technology exchange. UNIDO also has a role in building capacity for effective statistical information, especially in those countries where national statistical offices lack the technical capacity to establish a system in compliance with new statistical standards. This capacity building aspect of UNIDO’s work has decreased in recent years due to lack of UNIDO staff capacity. Interviewees noted that project managers and donors do not prioritise production of statistics and data, so resources for these in projects are often inadequate.<br>The IDR is produced on a two-year cycle, and databases are regularly updated. Statistical databases are available online and on CD-ROMs, with some annual and quarterly reports as PDFs; working papers and studies are accessed online or by PDF download.',

    'value': 'The objective of one of UNODC’s six substantive subprogrammes is to “enhance knowledge” of trends on drugs and crime to support evidence-based policy. UNODC’s Research and Trend Analysis Branch produces several flagship publications periodically, and there is evidence that these are used and valued. Individual programmes also tend to contain a research component. However, a recent evaluation noted that UNODC “has allowed political concerns to take precedence over credible research’ and that this has encouraged a “culture of conservatism” that is not in UNODC’s long-term interest. Interviews confirmed that this is an issue of concern internally. UNODC’s Research Branch is more dependent on programme funds than was the case historically: this dependence further undermines its ability to maintain the independence of the topics it focuses on and its findings.<br>UNODC aims to offer impartial, evidence-based information to member states to support policies on drugs and crime. The Objective of Subprogramme 6, “Research, trend analysis and forensics”, is “to enhance knowledge of trends on drugs and crime for scientific evidence-based policy formulation”. Knowledge production also runs through each UNODC intervention and is a key objective of several subprogrammes. UNODC’s Research and Trend Analysis Branch (RAB) produces several research flagship publications that are considered to guide debate and inform global action. It produces: the biennial Global Report on Trafficking in Persons; the World Drug Report; Homicide Study; and the World Wildlife Report. <br>UNODC cites as evidence that its knowledge products are used in research publications: the number of citations increased in 2018 (1 800 total). There is evaluative evidence that UNODC knowledge products inform action. An in-depth cluster evaluation (2018) of five of UNODC’s global research projects (covering its flagship reports) notes that UNODC “has made a substantial contribution towards improving the effectiveness of stakeholder response to current and emerging challenges”. However, the evaluation points out that overall there is inadequate data to identify impact due to an absence of relevant data and that some research “is not sufficiently analytical to be of much use in policymaking”. The cluster evaluation noted that many of the stakeholders reportedly used Thematic Programme on Research publications and found them useful as reference documents. MOPAN survey respondents hold UNODC’s knowledge products in very high regard: 33% rated the value of UNODC’s knowledge products for their work as “excellent”, and a further 38% judged the contribution as “very good”. <br>UNODC has built a global knowledge management platform (SHERLOC) to make information on implementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, its three protocols and the international drug control treaties accessible. In 2017, it had around 170 000 visitors.<br>Given that UNODC’s flagship reports are either annual or biannual and are produced on target, they are timely. However, the cluster evaluation notes structuring them in a more flexible way may be worthwhile: “Most stakeholders indicated preference for more frequent updates and operational information, so they could keep themselves abreast of new trends.”<br>The cluster evaluation highlights a result that risk aversion limits the quality of knowledge generated. It notes that “UNODC has allowed development of a culture of risk avoidance that is not in its long-term interest”. It notes that “UNODC has allowed political concerns (e.g. fear of backlash from some Member States) to take precedence over credible research (e.g. analysis that shows policy impacts)” and that “[t]his has encouraged a culture of conservatism and risk avoidance that is not in the long-term interest of UNODC”. The cluster evaluation called for a “bold long-term strategic vision for research”. Interviews echoed the findings of the cluster evaluation: we heard of instances of self-censorship and reluctance within the organisation to take on research that could prove contentious. Given that UNODC is a custodian of the UNCAC, the absence of a flagship annual report on global progress in combatting corruption is noteworthy. Giving the Research and Analysis Branch the same degree of structural independence that evaluation functions have would address several of these concerns.<br>UNODC‘s dependence on earmarked funding presents UNODC with a difficult balance. The cluster evaluation notes that an increased reliance of the thematic programme on projects for funding can “create unhealthy dependence that may compromise [a] programme’s independence and credibility”. It notes that there is a need to find the right balance between programming and operational independence for the thematic programme. UNODC has perhaps been deprioritising the importance of research in recent years. In its initial budget for the 2018-19 biennium, UNODC<br>removed a USD 2 million general purpose budget allocation that the Research and Trend Analysis Branch had previously received. FINGOV insisted UNODC review this and would not approve the budget as it stood. The outcome was that two-thirds of its budget is still provided by some form of core budget, leaving it dependent on extrabudgetary funds for a third of its budget.',

    'value': 'CGIAR has undergone a considerable process of reform and change over the last decade. In 2016, the CGIAR System was established. It comprises the 15 independent Research Centers, the Funders, the System Council, the CGIAR System Organisation, the Independent Science for Development Council, the Standing Panel on Impact Assessment, the CGIAR System Internal Audit Function and CGIAR Research. The new business plan sets out both the potential of the System and the outstanding challenges of continued reform. <br>The CGIAR System Framework sets out the structure of the CGIAR System: the Research Centers as independent and autonomous organisations, focused on research for development; the Funders providing guidance and financial resources; governance and administration for the System Organisation through the System Management Board and the System Management Office, respectively; with advice from the Independent Science for Development Council, Internal Audit Function and the Standing Panel on Impact Assessment. The business plan sets out a range of actions, which are aimed at creating a more efficient, focused and less fragmented System.<br>There is a clear commitment in the business plan to improving performance management, through a combination of careful evaluation of the past programmes and developing approaches to assure that current research management systems are designed, positioned and managed to deliver impacts as effectively and efficiently as possible, all aimed at driving improvements over time. These processes are still at the early stages of their development, and there are considerable concerns about the time that reform processes have taken and the need to keep a complex group of stakeholders together in the ongoing reforms. <br>The Evaluation of Partnerships concluded that the CRPs (CGIAR Research Programs and Platforms) created closer relationships between Research Centers, resulting from the need to plan programmes together, share funding and report jointly. In addition, partnerships, both within the System and outside, are central to the way in which CGIAR works, and their centrality is set out strongly in the SRF and business plan. It is, however, generally agreed that there is a need to go further to encourage greater co-operation across the CGIAR System.<br>The CGIAR SRF sets out an overview of responsibilities for results, with the basis in the formation of the CGIAR System under one unified governance structure providing a framework for the delivery of results. The aim of the round of governance reforms over 2016 and 2017 has been to deliver improved co-ordination, accountability and transparency in decision-making throughout the CGIAR System as a whole. This statement in the SRF comes with the caveat that this will also require an agreed and sustainable funding envelope to support the portfolio of CRPs. While some of this funding has been provided, the need for significant continued resource mobilisation by individual Research Centers undermines co-operation and the focus of the System as a whole.',

    'value': 'UNCTAD is a permanent intergovernmental body established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1964. Its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland, and it has two small offices in New York and Addis Ababa. UNCTAD is part of the UN Secretariat. Between quadrennial conferences, the Trade and Development Board oversees the activities of the organisation. It meets in Geneva in a regular session and up to three times a year in executive sessions to deal with urgent policy issues, as well as management and institutional matters. The Working Party on the Strategic Framework and the Programme Budget reviews UNCTAD’s communication strategy, publications programme, TC activities and programme of work.<br>In undertaking its programme of work, including TC, UNCTAD is organised into five divisions, each responsible for one of the five subprogrammes, namely:<br>Subprogramme 1: Division for Globalisation, Interdependence and Development<br>Subprogramme 2: Division for Investment and Enterprise<br>Subprogramme 3: Division for International Trade and Commodities<br>Subprogramme 4: Division for Technology and Logistics<br>Subprogramme 5: Division for Africa, Least Developed Countries and Special Programmes.<br>The structural arrangements of UNCTAD are directly aligned with these five subprogrammes, and all five contribute substantially to outputs in all three pillars.<br>In addition, there are programme support services that support these divisions to achieve their goals:<br>the Intergovernmental Support Service<br>the Technical Cooperation Section (TCS), managing project databases and providing co-ordination of TC activities<br>the Resources Management Service (RMS), responsible for the management of budget, finance, information technology and human resources<br>the Evaluation and Monitoring Unit (EMU)<br>the Communications, Information and Outreach Section.<br>Within the Office of the Secretary-General (OSG), there are also UNCTAD offices in New York and Addis Ababa. The five substantive divisions and the programme support services report directly to the OSG as do the New York office and the regional office in Addis Ababa.<br>At UNCTAD, the management of TC is de facto decentralised. While the 2003 TC strategy does not call for a decentralised operating model per se, this has evolved and been maintained over the years. Substantive divisions have autonomy to set division-level strategies. They each engage with partners, identify interventions, mobilise resources and implement activities. Consequently, different operating models for TC exist alongside each other.<br>TCS, located in the OSG, has a back-office support and co-ordination function for trust fund-related TC and an oversight role for UN Development Account projects. The OSG, represented by TCS, is involved in the review of new project proposals through a centrally co-ordinated electronic approval system, together with RMS, EMU, the gender advisor and the legal advisor. Secretariat-wide co-ordination of TC does take place and is being increasingly streamlined in a number of areas.<br>The operating model is reviewed every two years, as part of the Strategic Framework. Over the years, the organisational architecture has largely been maintained. TC is mostly managed by Geneva-based staff, often alongside other duties in the two other pillars of UNCTAD. In many cases, implementation is undertaken by UNCTAD’s regular budget-funded staff, complemented<br>by XB-funded project staff, and/or consultants and contractors on temporary assignments. In a few cases, dedicated project management units have been established (ASYCUDA, DMFAS) with mostly XB-funded staff.<br>The operating model is reviewed every two years, as part of the Strategic Framework.

In a few cases, dedicated project management units have been established (ASYCUDA, DMFAS) with mostly XB-funded staff.<br>Secretariat-wide, cross-divisional collaboration and co-ordination has been a persistent challenge for UNCTAD. UNCTAD recognises that interdivisional co-operation, which builds on the strength and expertise of different divisions, is important for the effective delivery of TC activities. Recently, the OSG has embarked on an organisation-wide effort to move from a division-based approach to management to a horizontal, task-based approach in certain areas, notably by creating cross-divisional working groups on statistical co-ordination, gender, financing for development and South-South co-operation.<br>Nevertheless, other than biannual management retreats and the Divisional Chiefs of Staff meetings chaired by the OSG Chief of Staff, we did not find compelling evidence of a structural, secretariat-wide and systematic approach to cross-divisional collaboration at directors level, in contrast to, for example, the research and analysis pillar. In practice, in TC, the level of co-operation between sections, branches and divisions varies considerably from project to project. It is undertaken mostly at an operational project/programme level, with different sections and branches contributing to each other’s interventions. Much depends on the staff’s own professional networks, experience and preferences.<br>The Project Review Committee is the secretariat’s main mechanism to enhance interdivisional co-operation and ensure the coherence of UNCTAD’s technical assistance. In practice, however, it does not perform this role in the way it was intended. It meets rarely and at irregular intervals. In 2018, the Committee held one face-to-face meeting to review the strategy for further deploying the results-based management framework for TC, the terms of reference of the Project Review Committee and the request database. The Project Review Committee could, in principle, perform a more strategic oversight role, if its terms of reference (TORs) were revised and it convened more regularly.<br>The de facto decentralised operating model allows for project- and programme-level co-ordination with other agencies. The degree to which UNCTAD engages in strong co-operation with other agencies varies considerably, again depending on how each division, branch, section and individual staff member approach this. The “eTrade for all” initiative stands out as a positive example of inter-agency co-operation, building on the principles of complementarity and comparative advantage.<br>Meanwhile, at the secretariat level, UNCTAD contributes to ongoing reform initiatives and system-wide efforts to strengthen inter-agency co-ordination. UNCTAD leads the United Nations Inter-Agency Cluster on Trade and Productive Capacity in delivering operational activities “as one” at the country level, in collaboration with UNIDO, UNDP, ITC, FAO, WTO, UNEP, ILO UNOPS and the five regional commissions. At the country level, TCS has driven efforts to contribute to 37 United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks (UNSDCF, formerly known as UNDAF).',

    'value': 'UNIDO’s organisational architecture is congruent with the MTPF in terms of the purposes of directorates and departments which relate to the overall strategic priorities of UNIDO. Following a restructuring in 2018, there are clearer links between the organisation and MTPF, for instance to strengthen the partnership directorate and integrate the field and technical co-operation directorates. The role of field representation in relation to the MTPF is not clearly identified, and therefore it is difficult to comment on the extent to which field offices are aligned with the strategic direction. UNIDO’s organisational model internally is highly centralised, and the field is not always well integrated with HQ, which is compounded by a limited field office capacity for engagement.<br>The organisation is heavily predicated on earmarked project funding, which potentially limits or distorts the alignment of the organisation’s structure with its strategic aims. For instance, the size of different directorates is generally related to the level of activity required, which in turn is related to the level of funding available. UNIDO does not always strike a clear balance between its roles as a normative organisation and as a technical co-operation organisation. The MTPF’s strategic objectives are not all equally visible within the architecture; for instance, knowledge and institutional strengthening, a new strategic priority introduced in 2018-21, is not as well-resourced and staffed in relation to other strategic priorities.<br>The operating model supports technical co-operation well, since it is largely based on implementing technical co-operation projects. Project development, management and implementation are a dominant activity within UNIDO. This leaves other aspects of UNIDO’s strategic plan, such as its normative and influencing work, less well-resourced and less clearly prioritised. The projectised operational model also limits UNIDO’s ability to consider the big picture results it wants to achieve, since it is often drawn into small-scale projects, with small-scale results. Dependence on earmarked funding also runs the risk that UNIDO is influenced by donor interests and priorities rather than pursuing it strategic aims. Recent adoption of a theory of change and IRPF, updated in 2019, may assist UNIDO in integrating its project-based activities better with strategic aims, and aligning them with organisational outcomes and impacts. More specialised project management teams and implementation, monitoring and reporting to align with the new IRPF and results focus are being piloted in 2019.<br>UNIDO recognises the need to continuously make sure “that the approaches adopted by the Organisation [are] periodically reviewed to ensure that it remains aligned with agreed United Nations system-wide frameworks and responds effectively to emerging new developmental challenges”. The MTPF was revised in 2017, and there has been a mid-term review in 2019 although this was the first ever mid-term review of a UNIDO MTPF. The operating model has not been reviewed, although there is a stated organisational commitment to reducing the number of projects in operation (estimated at 850 in 2019) and to increase the size/value of projects to support the twin organisational aims of scale-up and integration to achieve impact. The extent to which UNIDO can review the operational model is constrained by its lack of regular budget.<br>The MTPF 2018-21 places an emphasis on partnerships as a key element of UNIDO’s implementation approach. A set of Director General’s Bulletins (DGBs), promulgated by the Secretariat, define and operationalise partnerships which are at the core of UNIDO’s Programme for Country Partnership (PCP), an integrated engagement modality used in six countries to date which is intended to be spread and is being expanded further. It provides a model whereby UNIDO’s work is more than just project interventions, but rather is built around higher level partnerships with national country institutions, the private sector and donors to create interventions with greater impact and potential for sustainability. UNIDO is now considering developing clearer partnership modalities which can be more systematically used and will relate to the type of partners, project and also the country operating context, for example middle- and lower-income countries. The PCPs are still pilots and so far have largely helped to better co-ordinate UNIDO country projects, although there are some signs that they are now bringing together partners in new ways. <br>There is still not good integration between the field network and HQ, with continuing evidence of fragmented and siloed working. Recent changes in field network to HQ communications are beginning to lead to better co-ordination. <br>The IRPF shows how the different tiers and levels of results are aligned to the strategic priorities and core functions. Linkages between tiers and organisational levels of results for the IRPF are not clear, and responsibilities are not clearly allocated within the organisation. Project results are still frequently owned at project level and do not generally aggregate to country or global results frameworks. A new Quality Assurance Framework (QAF) means there is now clearer responsibility for results owned by relevant managers, but this was only promulgated in 2019.',

    'value': 'UNODC’s organisational architecture is only partially congruent with the strategic plan. <br>UNODC is a Vienna-based office of the United Nations Secretariat: it was established to assist member states in tackling illicit drugs, crime and terrorism. UNODC is positioned as the UN lead office in the fight against illicit drugs and international crime. It was established when the United Nations Drug Control Programme and the Centre for International Crime Prevention were merged in 1997. <br>Responsibility for delivering each of UNODC’s substantive subprogrammes is divided between and among its divisions. The Office is divided into four divisions: Operations; Treaty Affairs; Policy Analysis and Public Affairs; and Management. The Division for Operations is responsible for overseeing the field network and contains four regional sections. UNODC operates in all regions through a network of field offices. The division oversees eight regional offices, seven country offices, 17 field offices and 87 programme/project offices. It also houses UNODC’s Drug Prevention and Health Branch and its Justice Section. The Division for Treaty Affairs houses branches on organised crime and illicit trafficking; corruption and economic crime; and terrorism prevention. It also holds the Secretariat of the Governing Bodies. The semi-autonomous Secretariat of the International Narcotics Control Board is linked to the Division for Treaty Affairs, although it is functionally independent. The Division for Policy Analysis and Public Affairs houses UNODC’s Public Affairs and Policy Support Branch and its Research and Trend Analysis Branch (RAB). <br>Interviews indicated that there are several elements of the organisational architecture that stakeholders consider in need of reform: some mentioned that there is a lack of clarity and collaboration between headquarters units and between field entities. They noted there is sometimes an unhelpful gap between them, and the division of labour and allocation of responsibility are not sufficiently clear. <br>The International Narcotics Control Board is an independent and quasi-judicial control organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug conventions. It plays an important role in monitoring enforcement of restrictions on narcotics and psychotropics and in deciding which precursors should be regulated. Its budget is included in that of UNODC, but it is operationally and functionally independent, and therefore this assessment does not address it.<br>The operating model appears to support the implementation of the strategic plan to a limited extent. This is one of UNODC’s fundamental challenges, of which it is keenly aware. UNODC’s operating model is a function of its financial framework. UNODC is overwhelmingly reliant on tightly earmarked, often short-term donor contributions. As much as 90% of its total budget derives from voluntary donor contributions. It is therefore, to use a phrase from several interviewees, “donor-driven”. Its<br>ability to deliver value to beneficiaries is driven by what its donors are willing to finance. It has limited ability to strategically commit resources to either thematic areas of its mandate or to target groups that it would consider priorities unless donors are willing to provide finance. UNODC is keenly aware of this consequence, noting that its financial framework hinders its ability to deliver its mandate effectively: <br>“The unprecedented decline in general-purpose funds is unquestionably hindering the ability of UNODC to: (a) strategically manage its operations; (b) improve upon its management processes; (c) exercise effective corporate oversight; (d) fund key activities; and (e) launch new initiatives and programmes. As the flow of sustained unearmarked resources is key to the Office’s viability, UNODC continues to make calls to Member States to pledge adequate general-purpose contributions.” (7/111) <br>UNODC’s external audits have also reflected the continuing trend and the same negative impact on UNODC’s ability to implement its mandate: “The continuous decline, in absolute and percentage terms, of general purpose income negatively affects the medium-term ability of UNODC to: (a) implement its strategy; (b) improve upon its management processes; (c) exercise effective corporate oversight; and (d) launch new initiatives and programmes.” <br>Operationally, UNODC manages global, thematic, regional and country programmes through a combination of Vienna, regional and national field offices. This structure allows it to engage with a wide cross-section of stakeholders including regional entities, partner countries, multilateral bodies, civil society, research institutes and the mass media. <br>UNODC’s governing bodies – its two commissions and the UN General Assembly – can consider the Office’s operating model when reviewing and approving its budget documents. The assessment team did not, however, find evidence that the Office has initiated fundamental reviews of its operating model.<br>Interviewees raised concerns that UNODC as an organisation has not yet reviewed its business model in the light of the ongoing UN development system reform and has not yet identified and communicated internally or externally how it will adapt. There does not appear to have been organisation-wide discussions on this challenge and opportunity. The Division of Operations, however, which is responsible for the delivery of field-level interventions through UNODC’s regional and field network, has initiated an internal review of how UNODC needs to adapt. It is using the performance management system to encourage its staff to engage fully with the reforms. However, the Office does not appear yet to have identified its strategic position and developed a change management plan. Further, this review will not look at the global and thematic programmes delivered from headquarters. <br>There is evidence that UNODC’s de facto operating model, while in principle allowing for co-operation across the organisation and with other agencies, also sometimes undermines the potential for internal collaboration. UNODC’s operating model incentivises staff to secure donor funding to finance the vast majority of UNODC’s activities. Interviewees noted that there is often competition between units for donor funding – competition between headquarters entities themselves and between headquarters entities and field offices. The incentives for collaboration across the organisation are weakened by the imperative to raise funds that can be managed to sustain a unit’s or programme’s activities and staff. <br>Some subprogrammes are implemented by more than one division, which UNODC states allow for the leveraging of complementarities and synergies. And there were, of course, cases of strong cross-organisation working. But internal competition and a lack of internal collaboration were strong enough concerns to be raised by the majority of those interviewed. <br>UNODC’s current and draft 2020 strategic plans delineate which division or divisions have the responsibility for delivering the results set out in each subprogramme. Successive programme and consolidated budgets from 2014-15 have steadily improved how responsibility for results is identified. However, results remain aggregated at the level of subprogramme. There is no aggregation of results at the portfolio (organisation-wide) level. <br>The relationship between UNODC’s policy and delivery units and the unit responsible for supporting delivery, the Division for Management, introduces a degree of complexity to UNODC’s ability to deliver. UNODC’s Division for Management, while functionally part of UNODC, is simultaneously part of the UN Office of Vienna (UNOV). This is explored in detail in the text on MI 3.1.',

    'value': 'UNCTAD aligns its subprogrammes to relevant wider normative frameworks. For each of the five subprogrammes (i.e. covering all three pillars), the 2020 programme budget summarises the specific SDGs with which the objectives, and therefore the deliverables, of the respective subprogrammes are aligned. UNCTAD’s TC is particularly relevant to three SDGs, namely Goal 8 on decent work and economic growth; Goal 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure; and Goal 17 on partnerships for the Goals.<br>The objectives of the subprogrammes are also aligned with numerous other relevant agendas, including the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020 (the Istanbul Programme of Action), Agenda 2063 of the African Union, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 and the outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development, the outcomes and the Declaration of Principles and the Plan of Action of the World Summit on the Information Society, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014–2024, the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and the results of the 24th and previous sessions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.<br>Despite not having a comprehensive, up-to-date TC strategic plan, UNCTAD does acknowledge and respond to normative frameworks at the divisional level to a large extent. In this regard, UNCTAD sees TC as an important vehicle in assisting developing countries to achieve the SDGs as well as the objectives in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development.<br>In January 2017, UNCTAD established an interdivisional working group on the 2015-post development agenda and sustainable development objectives. Out of 17 SDGs, UNCTAD identified 7 as primary targets. Programme/project managers were required to identify primary and secondary SDGs in their project proposals and explain what has to happen for their work to contribute to the SDGs. The 2017 UNCTAD annual report was also updated to reflect its contribution to the SDGs.<br>The TC Toolbox links UNCTAD’s TC products directly to the SDGs and operationalises the strategy along with the objectives and indicators in the programme budgets. UNCTAD reports on its progress in mainstreaming SDGs in its TC activities on an annual basis. Results frameworks pertaining to TC have been developed at the product level that align the results of each product with the SDGs of focus and the targets under these Goals. At the project level, project officers are required to mainstream the SDGs into projects by describing how projects contribute to achieving the Goals; specifying relevant targets under the SDGs; using the findings of voluntary national reviews (on progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda) in project documents whenever such information is available; and ensuring that the SDGs of focus in the results framework match those selected for the product.<br>The two major programmes ASYCUDA and DMFAS in particular support national policy frameworks that incorporate global norms and standards. TCS works with UNDAF/UNSDCF processes that support normative frameworks. Project frameworks acknowledge 2030 Agenda indicators and targets. As per UN Secretariat requirements, TCS reports on expenditure against the SDGs within the annual Review of TC Activities and Their Financing, but not on results.',

    'value': 'UNIDO’s MTPF is aligned to the main normative frameworks relating to ISID; it is based on the global mandate received by Agenda 2030 for sustainable development which recognises the importance of ISID as a major driver for achieving SDG 9. The MTPF also makes explicit reference to the SDG framework in Level 1 of the IRPF, and interviewees also indicated its links to the SDGs. <br>The MTPF 2016-19 provided a suitable framework for UNIDO until 2017 to align with and contribute to the SDGs. Its revision in 2017 (covering the period 2018 to 2021) further consolidated the close and formal links between UNIDO results with the SDGs. This revision also provided for coverage of the 2020-21 biennium. This was necessary to allow for the alignment of the MTPF cycle to the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) of UN operational activities for development, in particular General Assembly resolution 71/243, which provides guidelines for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. There is also alignment with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and with UN system-wide coherence mechanisms, including the UN Resident Coordinator system. Alignment with other normative frameworks, such as those of ILO on labour rights and human rights frameworks, are not specified in the MTPF.<br>The IRPF provides clarity on the organisation’s expected contribution to global development results from normative frameworks relating to the SDGs, which are reflected in Tier 1 Level 1 of UNIDO’s MTPF and IRPF. Interviewees stated that the IRPF is a chance for the organisation “to tell their story” of how they contribute to Agenda 2030. Interviewees explained that the new IRPF is aligned with Agenda 2030 in relation to both UNIDO custodian indicators and the wider implications for Agenda 2030 on partnerships, poverty reduction and leaving no one behind. Level 1 indicators of the IRPF include industry-related SDG indicators in addition to SDG 9 indicators, to fully capture the contribution of ISID to the realisation of the SDGs. While norms and standards feature among the four functions, reference to critical sector-specific normative frameworks are mostly lacking, e.g. ILO core labour standards or UNEP conventions. <br>There is currently no clear system for tracking results in UNIDO, although UNIDO states a strong commitment to the principles of results-based management (RBM) and emphasises its commitment to improving capacity for results reporting. Documentation states that reporting on corporate results should be carried out on a quarterly basis on the Open Data Platform and annually in the annual report. Reporting should take the form of a corporate scorecard, partly based on data generated in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and partly on other internal and external sources. <br>While not solely accountable for achievement of SDG 9 indicators and targets, UNIDO was appointed as a custodian agency for six industry-related indicators under SDG 9 in 2016 by the UN Statistical Commission and is responsible for collecting data and monitoring for the SDG 9 indicators. It was noted by some interviewees that the SDGs are so macro it is hard for any single organisation to make a direct contribution or attribution to it, and many expressed the view that the IRPF is critical in showing UNIDO’s contribution. Accountability for other relevant normative frameworks is not specified.<br>UNIDO reports on its progress towards results at an aggregated level annually in its publicly available annual reports which showcase different results including normative results in relation to SDG 9.',

It also seeks to reflect national ownership, full participation in the reform of the UN Country Teams and unified reporting on the 2030 Agenda in these documents.<br>The subprogrammes detailed in UNODC’s 2018-19 strategic framework (embedded within the General Assembly’s overall “biennial plan and priorities”) state the results it is aiming to achieve relating to each element of its normative mandate. Funding is allocated to the normative work in UNODC’s biennual budget document and is identified within each of the subprogrammes. Against each of UNODC’s normative mandates, the strategic framework defines the “expected accomplishments of the Secretariat’ and, in a separate column, “indicators of achievement”. For example, to promote effective responses to transnational organised crime and illicit trafficking, the Secretariat will provide support to promote the ratification of conventions; one of the indicators is cited as an increased number of states parties ratifying the relevant convention. <br>The way UNODC measures results is set within the UN Secretariat action plan for the implementation of results-based management. Within UNODC, the Strategic Planning and Inter-agency Affairs Unit is responsible for ensuring that a results-based management (RBM) approach is mainstreamed into UNODC’s global, regional and national programming. The unit co-ordinates the formulation of the strategic framework of UNODC and develops institutional standards, methodologies and tools for results-based management for UNODC programmes and projects. As outlined in the Results section below (7.1), UNODC’s ability to track either normative or programmatic results is not yet effective. An organisation-wide RBM approach is not practised – though it exists in policy. UNODC is far from what is required to institutionalise a culture of managing for results at all levels. <br>There is, in principle, accountability for the achievement of normative results within UNODC. Branches and divisions within the Secretariat are responsible for the delivery of subprogrammes – in which normative results are embedded – and they are accountable, under the authority of the Executive Director, for their results. However, in practice, accountability systems are weak, as monitoring is largely absent (see MI 7.4). The following commissions and conferences of the parties covering UNODC’s mandates meet regularly and review budgetary and administrative issues. <br>The Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND)<br>The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ)<br>The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime<br>The Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption.<br><br>Insofar as the two commissions (CND and CCPCJ) give strategic direction to UNODC, they share accountability for normative results. The two conferences, in theory, also share accountability for their specific mandate areas. <br>UNODC reports on the implementation of some normative results at least annually. It reports on implementation at an aggregate level against the achievement of normative frameworks in its institution-wide annual report. Reporting in the annual report tends to be at the level of the activities and outputs. Insofar as UNODC’s global programmes are designed to implement the Office’s normative mandates, the Annual Results-Based Report examines implementation progress (this is an internal report for member states only). The latest available report covers 2018. Some of UNODC’s flagship reports – for example, its World Drugs report – also include reference to normative results the organisation has supported.<br><br>Within these mandates, UNODC gathers and analyses evidence that identifies trends and serves as a platform for action. It does this across and within five areas – or “service lines”, to use its terminology. Each service line also implements programmes (some of which are cited as examples).<br>Organised crime and trafficking – Mandate: UN Convention against Transnational Crime (Palermo Convention) and three protocols. UNODC and the World Customs Organisation implementing the Container Control Programme or the UNODC Blue Heart Campaign raising worldwide awareness about modern forms of slavery. <br>Corruption – Mandate: UN Convention against Corruption. Combatting environmental crime and corruption in Indonesia.',

    'value': 'There was optimism when the CRPs were first launched that Funders would provide a greater proportion of funding that CGIAR could use flexibly. After an initial period where this optimism was realised, Funders have increasingly resorted to more bilateral funding, through the Research Centers. Throughout these changes, CGIAR has worked hard to ensure that the main priority areas, primarily the CRPs, have received adequate funding. Efforts are now being undertaken to make the funding and allocation processes more transparent.<br>As a companion document to the business plan, the 2019-2021 CGIAR Research Financing Plan (2019-2021 FINPLAN) aims to bring together, in a single budget, all of the resources for the CGIAR Strategy. These are complemented by the CGIAR Trust Fund dashboards, available online, which should ensure greater transparency.<br>Following the September 2016 approval of the CGIAR Research Portfolio 2017-2021 by the System Council, the portfolio was launched in January 2017. The CGIAR Financial Report for 2017 was produced by the System Management Office and presented to the System Council and was published again in 2018 for review by the System Council.<br>CGIAR through the Trust Fund has put in place a number of means to designate resources to one or more of three System funding Windows: Window 1 - Contributions are received from Funders without restriction; Window 2 - Contributions are designated by Funders to specific CRPs; and, Window 3 - Contributions are allocated to specific Research Centers by Funders. <br>In the principles set out in the financing plan it is stated that: Funders may allocate Window 2 funding to specific Flagships within CRPs. In both the business plan and the financing plan, it is further noted: “Any Window 2 funds received in 2019 for a specific CRP or Platform that are more than the above allocations will be considered additional funds available for use by the CRP/Platform and will not result in a downwards adjustment of the planned allocation of Window 1 funds.”',

    'value': 'Financial and budgetary planning under the Montreal Protocol is based on a triennial assessment by the Parties and a three-year rolling business plan approved by the Parties (the 197 countries that have ratified the Protocol). As at May 2019, the total value of the 2019-21 consolidated business plan was USD 517 million. The total value of the 2019 consolidated business plan was USD 175 million, of which UNDP planned USD 32 million, UNEP USD 28 million, UNIDO USD 60 million, and the World Bank USD 46 million. At the end of each year, the cycle starts with the preparation of business plans for the following year by bilateral and implementing agencies. These plans propose target levels of controlled substances to be phased out and the level of funds to be disbursed, together with other performance indicators which provide the basis for the evaluation of the agencies’ performance. The business plans of the agencies reflect the activities that need to be financed and implemented during the year. These are reviewed by the EXCOM, and a consolidated business plan is produced. Meetings of the EXCOM include discussion of funding levels.<br>At the third meeting of the Executive Committee, it was decided that the budget of the MLF Secretariat should be in two separate parts: “the administrative budget, and the budget for operational activities (meetings, equipment and premises components)” (MLF, year unknown, Relevant Information on the Multilateral Fund). Financial and budgetary planning under the Montreal Protocol is based on a three-year rolling business plan approved by the EXCOM.<br>Documents and interviews confirm that the financial framework is regularly reviewed by the EXCOM and by the Meeting of the Parties. In response to the MOPAN partner survey question “Financial framework supports the effective implementation of the mandate and strategy”, 36% of respondents answered “excellent” and “44% “very good”.<br>Virtually all funding provided to the MLF by non-Article 5 countries is non-earmarked. Elements 4 and 5 are considered as not applicable for this reason. Non-Article 5 countries can use 20% of their annual contributions for bilateral projects. Only one non-core contribution was offered from the United Kingdom, but it was not accepted at that time. During 2017 and 2018, 17 donor countries (including Canada and the United Kingdom) did make voluntary “additional contributions” to the MLF for the purpose of assisting countries’ “fast-track” implementation of the Kigali Amendment.',

    'value': 'UNCTAD is financed through assessed contributions as part of the United Nations Secretariat and extrabudgetary or voluntary contributions from member states and other donors. All regular budget resources are approved at the level of subprogrammes. Post resources are approved in given categories and grades, while non-post resources are approved by budget class and budget line. Once the regular budget is approved, there is limited discretion for the UNCTAD secretariat on the usage of these resources. The regular budget is complemented by extrabudgetary  resources financed mainly through voluntary contributions. These contributions are mainly demand-driven and therefore earmarked for individual projects and activities.<br>The Proposed Programme and Budget documents describe the proposed programme plan for the following year/biennium and programme performance for the previous year/biennium. The documents outline the proposed post and non-post resource requirements by subprogramme as well as the organisational structure and post distribution and a summary of proposed changes in established and temporary posts by component and subprogramme.<br>The prerogatives to consider any administrative and budgetary matters is solely with the Fifth Committee and the relevant subsidiary organs, while other committees and organs are restricted to their specific substantive, sectoral or regional expertise. The Trade and Development Board falls under the category of other intergovernmental organs and therefore its involvement in budgetary matters is restricted to the consideration of the programme of work.<br>TC activities of UNCTAD and their financing are reviewed annually by the Working Party on the Strategic Framework and the Programme Budget of the Trade and Development Board.<br>TC is largely funded through XB sources (90.4%). Projects are (partially) self-financed or externally funded. Funding for TC is provided through extrabudgetary funding of trust funds, the United Nations Regular Programme of Technical Cooperation and the Development Account (8.7%), and the United Nations “Delivering as One” funding mechanisms (1%). Voluntary funding to trust funds is the principal funding source; the contribution to the trust funds from developing and transition countries rose from 43% in 2017 to 50% in 2018.<br>In December 2018, over 80 sources of funding contributed to 249 TC projects. In December 2018, the two major programmes of UNCTAD, ASYCUDA and DMFAS, accounted for about 56% of total expenditures (USD 25.5 million) and were financed mainly by direct contribution from the respective member states and from proceeds of loans or grants from international financial institutions. In 2018, MOPAN members contributed USD 9.8 million (28.9%) to the trust funds, other member states contributed USD 0.97 million (2.9%), while the UN system, other international organisations and private and public sources contributed USD 7.3 million (21.6%).<br>Whereas demand for TC is growing, contributions to trust funds for TC show an erratic and unpredictable pattern. In 2013, contributions amounted to USD 31 million. Compared with 2017, in 2018 TC funding decreased by 3% to USD 34 million. Compared with 2016, extrabudgetary funding decreased by 20% (from USD 40 million in 2018), while total expenditure for TC rose to USD 44 million. Conversely, 2019 saw an increase in funds, rising to almost USD 44m. Resource shortages, including in terms of staff, reduce UNCTAD’s ability to respond to all requests.<br>Many developing countries use self-funding options to benefit from TC. However, limited financial resources in other developing countries and vulnerable countries such as the least developed countries mean they continue to rely on the support of development partners to finance TC projects.<br>UNCTAD has categorised its TC activities over the past few years through the development and update of the TC Toolbox, which currently features a diverse portfolio of 28 TC products, reflecting the broad demand by member states and challenges in bringing greater focus. Although donors are encouraged to make unearmarked multi-year contributions, including contributions to the multi-donor thematic trust funds, in practice, this rarely happens. Currently, most of the trust fund contributions are tightly earmarked by single contributors for specific projects. Few donors provide predictable annual contributions regulated by a co-operation agreement signed between the donor and UNCTAD. A few trust funds established in UNCTAD share the features of multi-donor thematic funds, such as co-mingled contributions, greater flexibility in fund allocation and consolidated reports.<br>TC is not only demand-driven; it is also supply-driven and (donor) funding-driven. Reports from the research and analysis pillar as well as discussions in the consensus-building pillar tend to trigger new insights and demands. Nevertheless, TC requests remain pending until funding is sourced.<br>At a time when XB resources are unpredictable and largely earmarked, UNCTAD faces mounting pressure to deliver more results and, at the same time, to meet increasing demand from countries for support in implementing the new development agenda. Although these circumstances call for a concerted, focused fundraising strategy for TC, UNCTAD has thus far been lacking one. Previous attempts to address this were not met with consensus among member states.',

    'value': 'UNIDO’s financial and budgetary planning is presented in the form of a single, integrated budgetary framework, the Programme and Budget (PB) document by biennium of the planning period. It ensures all priority areas have adequate funding by programme and sub-programme, linking it to the IRPF and in line with strategic priorities. It also outlines a set of expected results, performance indicators and means of verification linking directly to the MTPF through the IRPF indicators. There are six programmes as follows, funded through a combination of regular and operational budget:<br>Policy-making Organs<br>Executive direction and Strategic Management<br>Thematic Programme Framework: Towards ISID<br>Corporate Management and Operations<br>Buildings Management<br>Indirect Costs.<br>The PB also includes four supplementary items in addition to the six major programmes. These are Special Resources’ for Africa, the Regular Programme of Technical Cooperation (RPTC), and Miscellaneous Income and the Special Account of Voluntary Contributions for Core Activities (SAVCCA). <br>The 2020-21 PB shows total net requirements to be EUR 142.6 million from regular resources as well as EUR 37.2 million from the operational budget. This is in addition to funding for technical co-operation which is extra-budgetary and stands at EUR 330 million. Of all the Major Programmes A-F, Programme C is by far the most heavily funded, receiving 83.8% of the total budget, but it is noted that most of this comes from extra-budgetary technical co-operation funding. A breakdown for technical co-operation delivery and support cost income shows that all areas of technical co-operation have funding. <br>Governing bodies review the financial framework each year through a medium-term investment plan which identifies gaps in regular budget funding by describing activities which have been “unfunded” and indicating their priority level. Interviewees explained that there is currently no full cost recovery (FCR) for projects, so UNIDO is effectively subsidising the operational budget with the regular budget (assessed contributions). A pilot on FCR is currently running on European Union projects with a view to claim FCR on all new projects from 2020 onwards. UNIDO governing bodies review financial performance of the organisation twice a year, and the DG reports to member states on the budget performance and implementation. Member states are being encouraged to contribute unearmarked or programmable funds, but there are not any incentives in place for this. There has been some growth in thematic trust funds built from unutilised contributions where member states agree to this, but this is in effect management of a different issue. UNIDO is largely funded through voluntary contributions (EUR 147 214 in 2018 compared to EUR 68 351 from assessed contributions). Voluntary contributions are perceived by member states to provide them with more control over use on operations. Most resources are earmarked (interviewees suggested around 98%); voluntary contributions recently exceeded assessed contributions by a factor of 3 and are accepted if considered in line with the organisation’s mandate.<br>There are no policies to ensure earmarked funds are targeted at priority areas, although the Programme and Budget frames earmarked funds under UNIDO programme areas. Staff suggested that earmarked funds are a way to ensure results are provided, but dependence on earmarked funds affects UNIDO’s ability to implement the MTPF. A major risk for UNIDO is dependence on external funding through earmarked contributions as strong reliance on earmarked funds may cause UNIDO to lose its independence and its ability to implement its strategic vision as well as to align activities to country priorities and results (MI 5.1). <br>Voluntary contributions to UNIDO are increasing, but at the same time regular resources are have decreased due to member states’ departure.',

    'value': 'UNODC has very limited ability to ensure that all priority areas have adequate funding. Its ability to do this is restricted by its lack of access to flexible finance. The volume and share of earmarked voluntary contributions – “special purpose funds” have been rising, reflecting higher donor investment in its activities. But core resources (general purpose funds and regular budget) have been declining in real terms and relative to non-core resources (special purpose funds) for several years. Core resources (general purpose funds) were forecast to be less than 1% in 2018-19. The volume of core resources UNODC receives is insufficient to finance functions that in other institutions would be considered integral (e.g. evaluation, gender, results management systems). UNODC must rely on special purpose funds – earmarked donor funds – to finance these functions. Most of its normative work is also financed from earmarked funds. UNODC is well below the average of the UN development system entities in terms of the share of core resources it receives. The average for the UN system in 2017 was 21%; UNODC was 10% in 2016 and declined to 7.6% in 2017. <br>Within these constraints, there is mixed evidence in relation to UNODC’s financial and budgetary planning to ensure priority areas have adequate funding. For example, the initial 2018-19 budget made an inadequate core funding commitment to the Research Trend Analysis Branch rendering the branch – which was largely dependent on core funds – vulnerable. The budget was rejected by member states and resubmitted with an allocation from core funds – including programme support costs (PSCs) (10/111).<br>UNODC’s terminology for funding sources is as follows:<br>general purpose funds: unearmarked voluntary contributions to finance core programmatic activities that are not funded by the regular budget (e.g. normative work, research)<br>regular budget: received from the UN biennial programme budget<br>special purpose funds: earmarked voluntary contributions for technical co-operation projects in the field or at headquarters (HQ)<br>programme support costs: overhead charge made against special purpose funds. PSCs are indirect costs that cannot be readily and directly attributed to, and are recovered from, activities financed from voluntary contributions (as per the supplement of the financial regulations and rules applicable to UNODC (ST/SGB/2015/4). PSCs are set for most donors at 13% (the European Union is charged 7%) and used to support central services.<br>UNODC income projections for the biennium 2018–19 highlight the divergence between earmarked and unearmarked funding. Income from special purpose funds (earmarked) was projected at USD 662.4 million (86.8%), and income from general purpose funds (unearmarked) was projected at USD 6.8 million (0.9%). The other two funding sources, programme support cost funds and the regular budget, account for 7.1% and 5.2% of the Office’s income. UNODC continues to face a persistent deterioration in general purpose income and added pressures on its regular budget and programme support cost funds. As indicated above, UNODC is also explicit that its financial framework hinders its ability to deliver its mandate effectively. The lack of general purpose funds reduces its capacity to: “(a) strategically manage its operations; (b) improve upon it management processes; (c) exercise effective corporate oversight; (d) fund key activities; and (e) launch new initiatives and programmes”. UNODC’s external audits have also reflected the continuing trend and the same negative impact on UNODC’s ability to implement its mandate. <br>UNODC creates a single integrated budgetary framework and has done so at least since 2014. However, voluntary contributions are also budgeted and accounted for separately under the two funds under which UNODC was established: the Fund of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund. Each biennial consolidated budget reports against the financial position of each fund separately. The reports set out anticipated general purpose income, the allocation of income from programme support costs to the Fund and anticipated special purpose income. Each Fund budget identifies the proposed commitment to each individual subprogramme.<br>The financial framework is reviewed regularly by the governing bodies. In line with General Assembly resolutions, the budget of general purpose funds (the “programme of the funds”), is presented to the commissions for approval. The budgets for special purpose funds (extrabudgetary support) and the related administrative and programme support cost budget (programme support cost funds) are presented to the commissions for endorsement only. <br>UNODC is seeking to introduce incentives to encourage donors to provide more flexible/un-earmarked funding at global and country levels, but, to date, this initiative has had limited impact. UNODC’s “Consolidated budget for the biennium 2018-19” and other documents state that “UNODC continues to make pleas to Member States and donors for unearmarked contributions”. Its draft annual programme implementation plan for 2020 states that UNODC is working on the assumption that there will be “less strictly earmarked special purpose contributions”, though without evidence that this will happen. <br>UNODC does seek multi-year funding and manages to get longer-term commitments in some cases. UNODC is structuring regional and country programmes in ways that allow donors to provide support to multi-year elements of the programmes. It concluded multi-year funding agreements with Australia and Qatar in 2016 and with Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom in 2018. However, a significant proportion of donors continue to provide small funding commitments that are often only valid for one year and are also often earmarked for very specific purposes. This funding pattern hampers UNODC’s ability to undertake sustainable planning and achieving long-term objectives since the financing of a significant share of activities and staff costs are only secured on an ad hoc and short-term basis.<br>The “standing open-ended intergovernmental working group on improving governance and financial situation of UNODC” (referred to internally as FINGOV) is an informal advisory body of member states. It is regularly briefed on the status of the budget, and its members are encouraged to provide more unearmarked contributions. In April 2019 UNODC presented to FINGOV a document applying the proposed Funding Compact to UNODC. The Funding Compact aims to raise core contributions to the UN to 30% of their budgets to help them support the achievement of the SDGs. <br>Through the Funding Compact, member states are committing to bringing core resources to at least 30% in the next five years. UNODC repeated its plea to member states to provide less hard-earmarked funding. It asked that, if general purpose funding cannot be provided, donors “soft earmark” their contributions. It also asked donors who have to “soft earmark” their contributions to dedicate them to one or more of UNODC’s “fundamental roles” or to specific thematic and/or geographic areas. UNODC identified its fundamental roles under four headings: normative work, strategic direction and policy support, knowledge leadership, and cross-cutting support functions. The latter includes roles or functions such as results-based management, evaluation and gender mainstreaming. <br>UNODC invited member states to engage in a dialogue to explore increased support to UNODC’s fundamental roles and how these roles could be matched with core resources. UNODC noted that it could highlight, in the consolidated budget, any funding gaps for fundamental roles that are currently funded through PSCs, extrabudgetary support or are not funded at all.<br>UNODC’s procedures and policies for planning and budgeting provide the overall framework governing how earmarked funds are targeted. However, given that around 90% of its budget derives from voluntary contributions, it is inevitable that funds are targeted to areas that are priorities for its donors as well as priorities UNODC identifies. <br>In 2014, to address falling general purpose income, UNODC introduced arrangements to achieve full cost recovery of donor financed programmes. In line with Secretariat-wide policies, UNODC costed its technical co-operation assistance. Since 2014, UNODC has continued to apply full cost recovery to all programmes and projects funded from voluntary contributions. <br>UNODC has stated that it has developed a monitoring and early warning dashboard on full cost recovery (the “full cost recovery barometer”) as a risk management tool to provide senior management with monthly and quarterly updates on full cost recovery implementation, to enable it to understand its cost base and to monitor recovery rates and their impact on the field office network and programme activities.',

    'value': 'Structures and mechanisms to support cross-cutting issues are quite fragmented within CGIAR, leading to slow progress on their integration, with the exception of environmental sustainability and climate change. Integrating a focus on gender equality and empowerment of women has been part of the CGIAR strategy since 2011, but there is widespread recognition and frustration within CGIAR that integration of gender issues into CGIAR’s science and workplaces has been partial and slow. Nevertheless, a high proportion of survey respondents rated CGIAR’s performance on gender as excellent or very good (over 45%). Since 2017, gender has been re-prioritised in the new System-level business plan through the development of a new gender and inclusion policy and people management plan, as well as through an injection of dedicated funding provided by donors to elevate a new Gender Platform within the CGIAR architecture. The Gender Platform is intended to provide leadership, expertise and resources across the System to better prioritise and integrate gender equality issues across CGIAR’s research. However, these measures are still in development, with implementation due to start in early 2020. <br>Environmental sustainability and climate change is a core focus of CGIAR’s research and substantially integrated into System-level strategies, Research Centers and research programmes. Although there is no dedicated policy statement on climate, CGIAR’s commitment to environmental sustainability and climate change is explicitly expressed in various strategic documents, the policies are widely implemented and the accountability systems are comprehensive. Substantial climate change leadership, expertise and resources are mobilised across the System by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), led by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, which is a collaboration among all 15 CGIAR Research Centers and co-ordinates with the other CGIAR Research Programs to integrate climate change. A high proportion of survey respondents rated CGIAR’s performance on environmental sustainability as excellent or very good (just short of 50%). However, more could be done to integrate climate change more consistently and strategically into the design of interventions, through expert advice and capacity building.<br>The definition of good governance used here focuses principally on the approach that CGIAR takes to partnerships, particularly at the national level including government agricultural research systems, and on capacity building of these partners. Working in partnerships and building capacity are integral to promoting CGIAR’s development outcomes at scale. A clear policy and strong accountability systems track a high volume of partnerships along the phases of the impact pathway. However, variability is noted in the strategic rationale and effectiveness of partnership strategies at CRP level. A further challenge is that financial and human resources are noted to be suboptimal for a more strategic, effective and sustainable approach. This is balanced by the concentration of resources and expertise in the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) directed towards the institutional policy and regulatory environment, which is the other aspect of good governance addressed by CGIAR. (The results of these efforts are discussed in KPI 9.6.)<br>CGIAR does not work explicitly on human rights, rather it is committed to protecting and promoting farmers’ rights, aligning with the System’s over-arching strategic commitment to the interests of poor farmers, both men and women. There was only a limited proportion of survey respondents who rated CGIAR’s performance on human rights as excellent or very good (only around a quarter). There is no explicit policy; however, CGIAR Research Centers that host genebanks have legal treaty obligations within the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) to protect and promote farmers’ rights within their approach to conserving and making available a global resource of germplasm from crops and trees. These obligations are further embedded within the System-wide Principles on Management of Intellectual Assets. This has an implementation plan but no accountability systems to track system-wide efforts on farmers’ rights. The Genebank Platform provides leadership, advice and guidance to Research Centers on farmers’ rights, but there are few other resources or development of capacity dedicated to ensuring a consistent approach.',

    'value': 'UNIDO has an internal control framework which “encompasses all the policies, procedures, monitoring activities and commitments, standards of behaviour and other aspects that govern UNIDO operations” (7). It is based on a set of core guiding principles and policies which are fully integrated into the management processes of planning, execution and monitoring and aimed at ensuring the effective and efficient management of UNIDO and use of resources.<br>UNIDO also has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Policy with the purpose of “embed [ding] a systematic and consistent approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks faced by UNIDO” (63). Interviews at HQ suggested that UNIDO’s risk management function is not yet mature, and the links between risk management and audit are not as strong as they could be, nor is the link between risk management and evaluation. Staff did explain though that information received on risk tends to align relatively well with audit findings and that UNIDO carries out its own annual risk assessment and assurance map for the risk committee. <br>It is unclear how issues identified through internal control mechanisms are to be addressed. The Report to the External Auditor for 2017 suggests that “the Internal Control Framework is outdated and does not reflect the current internal control system in place” (25), which is particularly evident in the case of risk management, which is still at its early stage of development. The ICF does describe various “control activities” that should help UNIDO achieve its objectives through addressing risks. <br>Guidelines for staff reporting of issues of concern through internal control mechanisms were not seen but would be covered by the policy on “Protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct or co-operating with audits or investigations”.<br>A tracking system to record issues and responses exists in the form of Management Action Plans (MAPs) which indicate the person or office responsible for ensuring specific actions are taken to address issues identified through audit. The EIO reports yearly to the IDB. HQ interviewees acknowledge that there are currently many outstanding audit recommendations including some that are over two years old, for example regarding IT and cyber security. This is attributed by UNIDO to resource constraints. Staff also suggested there are currently only five to seven internal audits conducted a year due to lack of capacity and resourcing, and likewise these constraints affect the organisation’s ability to act on the findings of audit including implementing timelines. <br>The Investigation Guidelines indicate investigations should be completed within six months of the receipt of a wrongdoing report, although timing depends on the complexity of the matter and case priority. The Director General’s Bulletin on “Protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct or co-operating with audits or investigation” paragraphs 22 and 27 provide for 45-day and 85-day timelines.',

UNODC also reports its follow-up action to recommendations made by its oversight bodies in an annex to each of its biennial consolidated budget documents. These provide the recommendation and action taken to implement it.<br>UNODC has stated that on a quarterly basis it monitors and reports progress made in addressing audit recommendations. The assessment did not have access to data on the timeliness of implementation, but the 2018 external audit notes that 62% of recommendations from 2017 had yet to be completed at the end of 2018. It states: “The Board noted that there were 65 outstanding recommendations up to the year ended 31 December 2017, of which 25 (38%) had been fully implemented and 40 (62%) were under implementation.”',

    'value': 'The Secretariat is administratively part of UNEP. UNEP, as a constituent part of the United Nations Secretariat, complies with General Assembly and Security Council Resolutions, United Nations Regulations and Rules, and administrative instructions and guidelines issued by the mandated authorities. Issues related to fraud, corruption and financial irregularities are directly addressed by OIOS through the UNEP Executive Office and the Corporate Services Division  following UN directives and guidelines. More specifically, Information Circular ST/IC/2016/25 on the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat governs UNEP as part of the UN Secretariat. In addition, UNEP issued Interim Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Guidelines to operationalise the internal circular. These guidelines define the roles of management and staff. While clear, these policies and guidelines are not specific to the Fund. <br>Interviews with Secretariat staff confirmed that policies and procedures are effective in practice, although there is no evidence of regular monitoring and reporting to the Governing Body. All staff at the Fund Secretariat have completed UN online anti-fraud training. No cases of fraud were reported to the Committee during the assessment period. Any cases would be handled by OIOS or the UNEP Corporate Services Division/Legal Unit on behalf of UNEP Executive Director. <br>There are several mechanisms in place for reporting suspicion of misuse of funds. These include UNEP internal operating procedures on whistleblowing, training on integrity and prevention of fraud and retaliation, and annual financial disclosure by managers and staff with financial responsibilities. Furthermore, OIOS has established a reporting facility to provide a confidential mechanism for individuals wishing to report waste, fraud, mismanagement, sexual harassment or other types of misconduct. The Investigations Division reviews all reports of possible wrongdoing it receives to determine whether the report is receivable for investigation. The Division has discretionary authority to decide which matters to investigate and, where suitable, may also decide to refer a report to another entity for appropriate action, including investigation.<br>UNEP, as part of the UN Secretariat, obtains oversight services from OIOS. Any fraud or attempted fraud would be directed to OIOS for investigation. UNEP does not issue a separate public report on fraud and corruption, although fraud, attempted fraud and corruption cases, if any, would be disclosed as part of its annual financial statements for audit to the Board of Auditors.<br>Previous MOPAN assessments for UNDP and the World Bank rated this MI as highly satisfactory. UNEP and UNIDO were assessed as satisfactory.',

Relevant policies on fraud and corruption are also available in Article 6 of the 2018 Procurement Manual. These are published. <br>Responsibility for meeting the organisation’s commitment to the proper use of funds and prevention of fraud rests with all staff members. “Managers at all levels have the additional overall responsibility for monitoring and assessing internal controls and preventing fraud” (61). The Policy on Fraud Awareness and Prevention also states that any managers who fail to take appropriate action or who directly or indirectly tolerate or condone improper behaviour shall themselves be held accountable. Staff at HQ explained how the “four eyes” principle is used for check and control. They explained that, although there is some decentralised procurement, there is a heavily centralised processing of payments in Vienna as there is no delegation of financial authority to the field. <br>UNIDO’s policy on fraud in all its manifestations is one of zero tolerance. UNIDO is committed to the development and maintenance of a control structure based on best practices, processes, procedures and system”. Documentation is clear regarding guidelines for reporting issues identified. Reports of misconduct should be made to the Director, Human Resource Management Branch, or to the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Ethics Office.<br>Staff at HQ have indicated that fraud awareness courses are among the mandatory training in UNIDO and also mentioned a “fraud awareness week” as well as various IT campaigns to help staff become aware and know what to do in the case of receiving fraudulent emails. The Policy on Fraud Awareness and Prevention commits UNIDO to “develop and conduct a training programme aimed at: increasing anti-fraud awareness, and developing skills for understanding, detecting, preventing and reporting fraudulent practices” (61).<br>Regular monitoring and reporting to the Governing Body annually provides evidence of policy and guideline implementation. An Information Circular summarising the findings and recommendations of investigations completed during the reporting period is issued annually, and an Activity Report is also issued annually to the Director General, the Board, the Audit Advisory Committee and the External Auditor. The Activity Report describes the activities of IOE during the reporting period and summarises significant oversight findings, recommendations and actions taken in response, but it is not made public.<br>Mechanisms are in place for reporting suspicion of misuse of funds, for example a policy for “Protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct or cooperating with audits or investigations” with the purpose of “protect[ing] those individuals working for the Organisation who report misconduct, provide information in good faith on alleged wrongdoing, or cooperate with an audit or investigation” (62). UNIDO commits to handling any such complaints with “the utmost discretion” and hosts a dedicated web-based reporting tool for allegations as well as a dedicated email address and telephone/fax number.

    'value': 'The four internal and external oversight bodies that cover the UN Secretariat are OIOS, the Board of Auditors, the Joint Inspection Unit and the Independent Audit Advisory Committee. Those bodies were established by the General Assembly to assist in promoting a culture of compliance and integrity and in deterring fraudulent acts by independently assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control systems and, in the case of OIOS, undertaking investigations into possible cases of fraudulent acts, as appropriate.<br>UNODC‘s policy and guidelines are set out in the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat (2016). OIOS provides advice on potential fraudulent acts and has a dedicated hotline to receive confidential reports, which can also be submitted through its website. The 2017 external audit report notes that UNODC’s intranet site did not provide a section <br>about fraud and corruption. Some information regarding fraud and corruption was available only through the search function. Although the United Nations intranet site provides such information, the Board recommended that UNODC should make its approach to fraud and corruption clearer to its staff by providing that information in a special section on its own intranet site. UNODC notes that instead of maintaining its own intranet, it will be part of a new UN intranet which will have a dedicated UNODC webpage on tackling fraud. <br>UNODC has created its own risk register, and an interdivisional team is developing risk mitigation plans. UNODC anticipates that this will be available on its intranet in the third quarter of 2019.<br>UNODC’s policy clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of personnel and the applicable sanctions. <br>Staff training and awareness-raising have been conducted, and information is circulated on UNODC’s Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the UN Secretariat. The UN intranet site provides information related to the prevention of fraudulent acts, including common or frequently asked questions and answers, hotlines, training materials and relevant documentation such as the organisation’s administrative instructions and Secretary-General’s bulletins. However, the 2017 external audit notes that, while training was mandatory, UNODC could not track compliance. This has been remedied, and UNODC reports that a Fraud and Corruption Awareness Workshop was held in April 2019 for Procurement and Finance staff.<br>UNODC’s Board of Auditors (2017) also found that in applying the UN Secretariat Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework, UNODC had not undertaken systematic fraud risk assessments to identify areas where it was most susceptible to fraud. The 2018 Audit Board report notes that UNODC is in the process of assessing its specific fraud risks and will update its enterprise risk management matrix in line with that of the UN Secretariat. UNODC expects to implement this recommendation by the second quarter of 2020. UNODC had established a fraud and corruption risk register in early 2019. At the time of this assessment, it was undergoing final review and, upon adoption in November, would be integrated into the overall Enterprise Risk Management register and framework. <br>Channels and mechanisms are in place to report suspicion of misuse of funds. Complainants should send reports to OIOS.<br>OIOS submits annual reports to the General Assembly and makes references to specific investigations of possible misconduct, including fraudulent acts. On an annual basis, the Secretary-General reports to the Assembly the number and nature of cases involving credible allegations. In its audit report of 2018, the Audit Board states that there was a discrepancy (of three cases) between the reports of fraud and presumptive fraud cases that it received from OIOS and those from UNODC management. The Board notes that this indicates there is an “undesirable inconsistency because the lack of accurate information related to fraud may imply a potential risk for the entity, with financial implications”. It recommended that UNODC management improve co-ordination with OIOS.',

A gender strategy, developed in 2011, will be updated with a view to incorporate the 2020 UNCTAD XV conference outcomes. UNCTAD identified two goals for gender equality and women’s empowerment (GEWE) in the 2018-19 biennium programme and budget proposal. Organisationally, a gender task force (network of gender focal points within each division) has been established to reinforce and broaden the scope of UNCTAD’s activities for women’s economic empowerment. The gender parity strategy 2018-21 sets gender targets in priority areas of human resource management. In 2016, gender became an explicit component in the design and screening of new TC interventions. Results on the ground are yet to flourish, but the overall trajectory seems positive.<br>This cannot be said for two other cross-cutting items in TC, namely environmental sustainability and climate change, and respect for human rights. Whereas UNCTAD is showing a growing interest in environmental sustainability and climate change and is engaged in a number of TC projects to that effect, there is no evidence of secretariat-wide adoption and integration of environmental sustainability and climate change considerations into UNCTAD’s TC. Processes and mechanisms to incorporate these considerations throughout the project cycle are lacking. Similarly, with regard to human rights, although the Maafikiano does identify human rights as a priority cross-cutting issue, this has not been operationalised. While human rights are included in due diligence requirements and some isolated examples of projects that explicitly address human rights do exist, there is no evidence of secretariat-wide adoption and integration of human rights considerations in UNCTAD’s TC. Processes and mechanisms to incorporate these considerations throughout the project cycle are lacking. Staff have not been trained, nor has any bespoke guidance for UNCTAD staff been developed.<br>While enhancing economic good governance is a critical programmatic area and implicit in relation to UNCTAD’s mandate, the secretariat has no clear definition or explicit economic governance strategy or business processes in place. Still, many TC programmes and projects do include an explicit objective to improve economic policy and strengthen the capacity of relevant government institutions. At the level of the five subprogrammes, but more so at the level of individual projects and programmes, indicators of enhanced economic governance capacity are included in plans and reported against. UNCTAD events and training also include a focus on improving economic governance, and staff regard this objective as a sine qua non. UNCTAD’s partners appreciate UNCTAD’s assistance in this regard.',

A core part of UNODC’s mandate is to promote good governance; its governance work is a strength.<br>UNODC has a clear strategy on gender equality. It was approved in December 2017 and is still in the early stages of being implemented. The Action Plan to operationalise the strategy was adopted in December 2018 – leaving just six months for implementation in the assessment period (January to June 2019).

As a UN Office, UNODC subscribes to UN-wide policies on environmental sustainability and climate change. It contributed to the creation of the UN Sustainability Strategy (2019) and subscribes to the UN Secretariat’s Climate Action Plan (2019) and the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, three of which relate to the environment.

    'value': 'The first Consortium Level Gender Strategy (CLGS) was adopted by the Consortium Board in September 2011, with two pillars: gender in CGIAR research and gender and diversity in the CGIAR workplace. However, the 2017 independent Gender Evaluation found that, overall, the CLGS did not provide a clear accountability framework or road map for gender in CGIAR Research and in the workplace and called for an updated gender framework. The new business plan’s prioritisation of gender policies effectively responds to this recommendation, although work is still in development. Documents and interviews suggest that CGIAR Research Centers and CRPs have gender frameworks in place, although these vary in scope and degree of implementation. A high proportion of survey respondents rated CGIAR’s performance on gender as excellent or very good (over 45%).<br>Gender equality indicators are integrated into the CGIAR SRF, which includes an IDO and set of three sub-IDOs as the basis for accountability. Gender is further set out as one of eight research priorities. There are additional gender specific targets under two of the SLOs on poverty and food and nutrition security. However, these indicators are at an outcome level and do not allow close tracking of how gender concerns are being integrated into the design and implementation of research and human resources policies.<br>There is an accountability system in place, which is broadly implemented, but it is fragmented and so tends to track gender-related projects and initiatives rather than progress towards gender integration. Data on the IDOs and sub-IDOS reported by CRPs are disaggregated by gender, while the CGIAR Annual Performance Report for 2017 includes a section on Integrating Gender and Equity into CGIAR Research for Development. Interviews suggest that the gender accountability system does not work consistently, hence the renewed focus on it. Evidence from interviews expressed an expectation that there will be more regular quality data and progress reporting on gender in the future, as gender reporting is also one of the new performance management standards being implemented in 2019-21.<br>There are no gender screening checklists or similar tools for new interventions. Gender is required to be included in the annual research programme Plans of Work and Budget (POWBs), but interviews suggest that this is inconsistent. A number of Research Centers have gender focal points, while on the programme side, expertise is mobilised via the CGIAR Collaborative Platform for Gender Research. The Platform serves a wider community of researchers integrating gender analysis into<br>their research and of those who are interested in collaborating on gender research, methods, tools and knowledge.<br>Currently, resources available to address gender are sub-optimal, as noted in the 2017 Gender Evaluation. In the research programmes, Phase 1 of the CRPs saw a small amount of funding dedicated to gender research, but this was not a feature of Phase 2 CRPs. Currently, gender expertise and funding is channelled through the Collaborative Platform for Gender Research, which is now in the process of being elevated to a stand-alone strategic platform with considerable funding. The Gender Platform will have an enhanced ability to receive and manage larger flows of resources across the System, so the situation should improve in the future, from early 2020.<br>Capacity development of staff in gender issues has not been implemented systematically or strategically in CGIAR. The Evaluation of Gender in CGIAR (2017) recommended a comprehensive system-wide training programme on gender and diversity, which was not supported by the management response and was left to Research Centers to manage. Interviews suggest that there has been variability on how Research Centers have addressed this.',

Gender is not included in mandatory reporting. No gender disaggregated data are collected on projects and programmes. A 2018 evaluation survey found no formal gender screening checklists but recognised that more efforts might be happening in practice. <br>The 2018 desk study reported a scarcity of dedicated resources for gender. The 2018 desk study on gender reports that “the scarcity of dedicated resources makes the gender impact of MLF projects unaccounted for, even if the MLF projects may have some important gender dimensions such as the creation of job opportunities for both men and women; the training of farmers exposed to toxic chemicals to better handle such unhealthy conditions; and the introduction of better occupational practices for both men and women”. There is no gender training for project staff and little or no collaboration with IA gender focal points/advisers.<br>The survey found that the majority of respondents knew “just a little” or ”almost nothing” about the gender equality strategy of the MLF.<br>A gender analysis of the MP conducted in three countries in 2019 found similar issues regarding the role of women in the refrigeration sector and the constraints women face at entry points in projects design.',

    'value': 'Over the past years, UNCTAD has made notable progress in developing policy aimed to promote mainstreaming of gender equality and women’s empowerment in TC, a development that is recognised by the Joint Inspection Unit of the United Nations (JIU) and UN Women through the UN-System-Wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (GEEW) exercise.<br>The Nairobi Maafikiano and subsequent strategic frameworks state that UNCTAD will continue efforts in all its work to mainstream cross‐cutting issues of gender equality and the empowerment of women, and the promotion of sustainable development and full and productive employment. Leadership and executive management are very engaged and committed. A gender strategy was developed in 2011 covering six areas of UN-SWAP policy. This was complemented by UNCTAD’s gender parity strategy 2018-21. The gender strategy will be updated with a view to incorporate the 2020 UNCTAD XV conference outcomes.<br>In 2016, gender became an explicit component in the design and screening of new TC interventions. All new interventions are now assessed by the gender focal points as part of the formal secretariat-wide approval process. Guidance, including a checklist for gender mainstreaming, has been developed and made available through the secretariat’s intranet. In its gender parity strategy, UNCTAD commits itself inter alia to review all UNCTAD’s technical assistance programme and mainstream gender in them.<br>Substantively, UNCTAD has identified two GEEW goals in the 2018-19 biennium programme and budget proposal, namely: improvement in the mainstreaming of gender perspective into the work of UNCTAD; and increased number of initiatives mainstreaming a gender perspective into the work of UNCTAD.<br>Organisationally, UNCTAD has appointed gender focal points within each division. In March 2018, the Deputy Secretary-General (DSG) created a special Gender Task Force, building on the work of the pre-existing Network of Gender Focal Points. Its purpose is to reinforce and broaden the scope of UNCTAD’s activities for women’s economic empowerment through trade, investment, innovation, technology and all other areas under the three pillars of work of UNCTAD. The Task Force emphasises the importance of cross-institutional and cross-divisional implementation of gender-mainstreaming aspects. It is chaired by the DSG and meets at irregular intervals, as a result of which momentum at the operational level is said to have decreased.<br>The gender parity strategy 2018-21 sets targets in priority areas of human resource management. Presently, there is a mandatory training on gender; standards of practice regarding recruitment and gender; and a deliberate policy to establish a conducive enabling environment that promotes internal mobility opportunities, flexible working arrangements, and capacity building and training for female employees. An online training module on Trade and Gender developed together with UN Women in 2017 is still active and available for all UN staff through the UN Women Training Centre. In collaboration with the ILO Training Centre in Turin, Italy, a training session on gender mainstreaming in publications and TC projects was held in February 2017 for TC Gender Focal Points. Funding for tailored in-person training, however, is very limited.<br>Progress on gender within UNCTAD has been acknowledged by the JIU and reflected in the annual UN-SWAP reports. UN Women has commended UNCTAD for its continuous efforts to strengthen gender equality and women’s empowerment, both in TC activities and within the secretariat itself, e.g. by adopting the UNCTAD gender parity strategy 2018-21. The 2018 UN-SWAP report appreciates a consistent trend of satisfactory performance across various indicators: policy and planning, gender responsive performance management, results-based management, oversight and coherence. In other areas, such as human and financial resource management, organisational culture, and capacity assessments, UNCTAD was seen as approaching the requirements. This is corroborated by evidence from evaluations, that demonstrate a solid commitment to improving gender outcomes.<br>There is less evidence of impact on gender equality and continued reference to the need to strengthen gender mainstreaming and training, however. The independent external evaluation of subprogramme 5, in 2018, recommended that UNCTAD and the division should increase current efforts and integrate human rights and gender equality issues into interventions, to better deliver on the mandates and commitments of the United Nation. In a similar vein, the 2018 synthesis of subprogramme evaluations concluded that “with the exception of the trade and gender programme under subprogramme 3, the integration of gender and human rights considerations in UNCTAD programmes and projects has been weak”. It should be noted that these subprogramme evaluations span from 2013 to 2018, but the overall trajectory is positive.<br>Survey responses indicate that 41% of member states are (very) familiar with UNCTAD’s stance on gender equality and empowerments of women; 59% knew little to nothing about it.',

    'value': 'UNIDO has a dedicated Policy on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as well as a Gender Strategy (2016-19) and a Gender Parity Action Plan (2018-21). The strategy indicates that “[w]hile important goals in their own right, gender equality and women’s empowerment are key to UNIDO’s goal of achieving inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID)” (29) and notes gender parity, gender sensitive culture and accountability as three organisational priority areas. These are widely cited by staff in relation to issues on gender, although there is also an acknowledgement (from interviews) that the organisation still has room to improve performance in relation to gender equality.<br>The MTPF describes gender equality as “a central priority of UNIDO’s strategic framework for the 2018-2021 period” (1), and the IRPF includes targets and indicators for gender and gender equality under its Tier 2 (organisational performance) results, and for gender mainstreaming and gender partnership building under Level 3 (programme management and effectiveness). UNIDO reports in their annual report on the KPIs related to gender equality. <br>UNIDO established a senior level mechanism in 2015 to ensure accountability through the Gender Mainstreaming Steering Board, chaired by the DG and comprising directorate heads. The organisation also created an Office for Gender Mainstreaming, Ethics and Accountability (ODG/GEA) in 2015. Documentation indicates that ultimate authority and responsibility for achieving results rests with the DG but is the responsibility of all staff. UNIDO reports on its gender-related results to member states including through reporting on the UN-SWAP. One function of the Office of Evaluation and Internal Oversight is to “ensure human rights and gender issues are duly considered in the conduct of evaluation and evaluation reports” (29). A sample of evaluations reviewed has confirmed this is the case for gender, but the evaluation findings in themselves suggest gender is not always actually addressed well in practice with there being “no systematic consideration of gender equality issues”.<br>The mid-term review (MTR) found good progress has been made in ensuring gender-responsive designs, institutional arrangements for gender and resource tracking through the gender marker system. Less progress was noted in mainstreaming gender-related responsibilities and ensuring accountability across the organisation. The Gender Strategy indicates that all new projects ought to systematically include gender perspectives. Gender equality is now a mandatory part of the project approval and compliance process with its own gender checklist. Interviews at HQ explained that two staff acting as Gender Focal Points look through every project proposal and discuss it with project managers<br>Regarding human resources, a network of Gender Focal Points (GFPs) has been established with representatives from all branches and field offices. Working alongside a gender co-ordinator and rotating gender officer, these personnel increase the capacity and human resourcing for gender within UNIDO, but it not always sufficient, especially at the country level where regional and country capacity is limited. The network of GFPs are effectively responsible for gender work on top of their existing roles, so that there has not in practice been additional resourcing. Regarding financial resources, the PB 2020-21 has a budget line under Major Programme D for “Human Resource Management and Gender Mainstreaming” which shows EUR 6 639 335 from the regular and operational budget for this and 11 professional positions and 19 general staff positions. The previous PB 2018-19 had a dedicated component D.1.1 for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.<br>Interviewees at HQ indicated that participation in training on gender equality is now tracked systematically. They also suggested that increased staff capacity on gender equality issues is indirectly reflected through increased quality on gender mainstreaming of projects, as reported in the Annual Report 2018 and as found in the 2018 Mid-Term Review of the Gender Equality Policy (2015) and Strategy (2016-19) on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. <br>The percentage of programmes/projects whose design quality was rated satisfactory at entry in relation to gender equality has increased from 59% in 2015 to 89% in 2018. A system of recognition to reward gender champions has been put in place with the gender equality mobilisation (GEM) award.',

    'value': 'UNODC has a clear policy and strategy on gender equality (Document number 17). It was approved in December 2017 and is still in the early stages of being implemented. The Action Plan to operationalise the strategy was adopted in December 2018 – leaving just six months for implementation in the assessment period (January to June 2019). Because there has been insufficient time to drive delivery of the plan, there is not yet consolidated evidence showing use. <br>Reflecting UNODC’s lack of core funding, its gender equality and mainstreaming work (staff and activities) is funded by extrabudgetary funds and is framed as a “global programme”. UNODC’s dependence on donor funding for its gender equality work means it is dependent on future donor commitments, and therefore its sustainability is not guaranteed. The gender unit and programme have been placed within the Office of the Executive Director. <br>Gender equality indicators and targets have recently been integrated into the organisation’s strategic plan and corporate objectives. UNODC aims to deliver against 14 targets (or strategic performance areas) with 2019 as the mid-term and 2021 as the end of term targets. The targets are based on the five-level rating system of the UN System-wide Action Plan framework, which allows UN entities to assess themselves and report against each performance indicator. Specific actions for reaching the targets and monitoring implementation are outlined in an action plan for 2018-19. Accountability systems (including corporate reporting and evaluation) that reflect gender equality indicators and targets are now being put in place, but there is not yet evidence of their use. The Executive Director is responsible for delivering and accomplishing the implementation plans’ goals and targets, and senior management is responsible for reviewing results and strengthening implementation. UNODC’s strategy provides for a mid-term review and final independent evaluation. Gender screening checklists have been developed and have begun to be used in relation to new interventions. Capacity development of staff on gender equality is underway, and a system of gender focal points has been established. But, as with UNODC’s policy and implementation, this is in the early stages of implementation.<br>The element scores in this micro-indicator reflect that UNODC’s gender policy and implementation plan are so recent that there has not been adequate time to demonstrate results: they are either partially implemented or implemented only in some cases. It is important to note that this score is not a reflection on the quality of either the policy or the systems that have been put in place: these appear of high quality.',

Improved natural resources and ecosystem services is the third SLO (of 3), with 4 underlying IDOs and 11 underpinning specific outcome targets covering a range of climate and sustainability areas. Climate change is also one of four key cross-cutting themes that are critical to attaining the goals and targets. The accountability system for environmental sustainability and climate change is substantially implemented. The CGIAR Annual Performance Report for 2017 includes a wide range of examples where research is making a contribution to adapting to and mitigating climate change. The reporting is at the SLO level and for the Common Results Reporting Indicators. There is also reporting against the climate sub-IDOs in the CRP annual reports.<br>There are no specific environmental screening checklists/impact assessments used for new interventions. Annual POWBs are required to indicate which components of the work programme contribute to climate change and environmental efforts. Interviews suggest that CCAFS is asked to provide climate change advice to other programmes, as well drawing on the extensive climate change experience in the Research Centers. There do not seem to be other procedures or tools in place to assist in the integration of climate change into the design of new interventions. <br>In terms of human and financial resources to address climate change and environmental issues, the CCAFS programme represents a substantial concentration of leadership, expertise and resources in the System. All 15 Research Centers have a stake in CCAFS, and interviews indicate that this collaboration means that efforts can be co-ordinated across all parts of the System and made more strategic. This somewhat balances the minimal capacity building of staff to support integration of climate change and environmental issues. Interviews suggest that there may be an ongoing need to build the capacity of scientists to integrate climate change more strategically and consistently into projects and Flagship portfolios.',

    'value': 'From a policy perspective, the Nairobi Maafikiano explicitly states the importance of “integrating (economic, social and) environmental dimensions of sustainable development and creating an enabling environment at all levels for inclusive development” (pp. 2-3). It recognises all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as set out in principle 7 thereof. For the 2018-19 programme and budget biennium, subprogramme 3 identifies as one of its objectives, “enhanced design and implementation by developing countries […] according to their needs, of trade, environment and sustainable development objectives and creative economy strategies at all levels.” Aside from these high-level commitments, there is no dedicated policy on environmental sustainability and climate change for TC.<br>UNCTAD is showing a growing interest in climate change and trade, as witnessed during the Trade, Climate Change and SDG week that UNCTAD organised in September 2019. Interviewees also point to numerous efforts recorded at the corporate level to comply with environmental sustainability and to highlight the nexus between trade and climate change, which fall beyond the scope of this assessment.<br>In terms of TC, one of UNCTAD’s TC Toolbox products is “Sustainable Trade and the Environment”, managed by the Division for International Trade and Commodities (subprogramme 3).<br>At the project level, there are an increasing number of projects that focus on environmental sustainability and climate change. One major initiative is the BioTrade approach that was developed to consider the implementation of the BioTrade Initiative that has been promoting sustainable BioTrade in support of the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This has resulted in a range of projects and policy initiatives. However, there is no evidence to show that environmental sustainability and climate change are being mainstreamed in UNCTAD’s TC.<br>Although the Maafikiano regards environmental sustainability and climate change as an important cross-cutting issue, within TC, this has not yet been operationalised in terms of specific guidance to TC interventions, nor has it been given the same weight and attention as, for example, gender equality. While UNCTAD’s project screening checklist and project management handbook do make reference to ensuring alignment with SDGs, there is no evidence that UNCTAD’s TC guidelines, systems and tools address the issue of sustainable development and climate change in any explicit manner. Processes and mechanisms to incorporate these considerations throughout the project cycle are lacking. Staff have not been trained, nor has any bespoke guidance for UNCTAD staff been developed.<br>Survey responses indicate that member states are not that familiar with UNCTAD’s stance on environmental sustainability and climate change. One-third of the respondents claimed to know it well or by a fair amount; two-thirds knew little to nothing about it.',

    'value': 'There is no dedicated policy statement on environment and climate change; however, “safeguarding the environment” is one of UNIDO’s four strategic priorities (it is an integral part of UNIDO’s work rather than a cross-cutting issue per se). This is to be done through advancing environmentally sustainable growth, building institutional capacities for greening industries through cleaner production technologies and resource efficiency methodologies, and creating green industries, including in fields of waste management and recycling. Implementation of Global Environment Facility (GEF) standards is a dominant aspect of the extra-budgetary project portfolio. The mid-term review of the MTPF highlights the cross-cutting causal relationship between environment, on the one hand, and poverty, food, health, and other SDG-related results. The partner survey identified more positive views on UNIDO’s work on the environment and climate change than for other cross-cutting issues. While UNIDO, particularly given the dominance of GEF and Montreal Protocol funded projects, has a clear agenda for the environment, there is no clear statement of UNIDO’s organisational intent on the environment.<br>The IRPF includes targets and indicators for environmental sustainability and climate change. Under Level 1 (global development results) there are indicators for CO2 emissions and energy intensity. Under Level 2 (country results with UNIDO ISID support) there are indicators for multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). There are no organisational performance indicators for environmental sustainability.<br>To strengthen accountability to supporting environmentally sound and sustainable development in their project activities, UNIDO has adopted a set of Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies and Procedures (ESSPP). These strengthen UNIDO’s accountability to the countries and communities it aims to support as well as stakeholders in the development processes and the broader development co-operation and donor community. The ESSPP state that whenever<br>appropriate the organisation engages “in innovative investments and technical assistance to support no/low-carbon investments and climate change mitigation and adaptation opportunities while also working with the project development team to ensure that supported projects enhance climate resiliency and avoid unwarranted increases in greenhouse gas emissions”. The ESSPP draw on the safeguard requirements and policies of the GEF and Green Climate Fund (GCF), as well as United Nations Environment Management Group guidance; however, given their recent introduction in February 2019, they have only been rolled out for new projects so it is not yet possible to assess their impact.<br>The ESSPP (since 2019) act as an environmental and social screening and assessment tool for UNIDO interventions and consist of four interrelated components as follows:<br>Integrated Safeguard Policy Statement<br>Operational Safeguards<br>Environmental and Social Safeguard Steps along the Project Cycle<br>Environment and Social Safeguard Tools. <br><br>The “Environmental and Social Safeguard Steps along the Project Cycle” provides guidance on the specific procedures that the project development team should follow to ensure that operations meet the requirements of the Operational Safeguards at each stage of the UNIDO project cycle, and the Environment and Social Safeguard Tools are designed to screen projects for environmental and social risks and develop the environmental and social studies required by the ESSPP. GEF projects are screened using a similar tool, on which the ESSPP are based.<br>Both human and financial resources are available to address environmental sustainability and climate change issues for projects and programmes; UNIDO has a dedicated Department of Energy and Department of Environment. Programme C.3 of the Programme and Budget document 2018-2019 covers UNIDO services in the area of safeguarding the environment. In terms of financial resources, close to EUR 10 million of UNIDO’s resources the released budget for 2019 was mostly for personnel costs. There are no dedicated resources for supporting organisational environmental sustainability.<br>The ESSPP compliance regime is managed by the Partnership Coordination Division (PCD). UNIDO is currently engaged with the GCF and has other partnerships such as with the Global Mercury Partnership and the United Nations Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE).<br>Personnel at HQ explained how training on ESSPP compliance, originally developed for GEF projects to be compliant with GEF requirements, was conducted for the energy and environment departments staff during the initial rollout of the policy in 2015, due to their involvement in GEF projects. Since then, all GEF/GCF training includes ESSPP elements.<br>Interviewees at HQ explained how UNIDO is aspiring to “Green Procurement”. UNIDO is working towards its travel policy becoming climate neutral, and has revised it. All travel is monitored, checking that face-to-face meetings are necessary, and there is now a cap on travel days and budget, although this is also for cost management purposes. The organisation has increased the amount of telecoms equipment and spaces in HQ, and all Country Offices have IP phones to encourage remote connection.',

    'value': 'The assessment found that interventions delivered under the Montreal Protocol were suitably aligned with national priorities. The MLF employs a country-driven approach to allow national authorities the flexibility to determine their preferred means to go about meeting their obligations under the Protocol.<br>Intervention designs and implementation appear to employ suitable contextual analysis. Planning documents require that information be provided on the operating context, including potential climate and environmental impacts. At the time of the assessment, MLF did not consider gender in the development of interventions. Project submission guides have since been changed to require this.<br>A review of MLF documentation relating to intervention design and implementation found almost no reference to capacity analysis – for example, assessments of national partner capacity. Neither did the document review find a reference to the requirements/expectations set by the MLF for the assessment and management of risk. The Secretariat affirmed that the MLF always considers capacities at national and enterprise levels and that operational risk analysis is done through project review. <br>The extent to which intervention designs take into account cross-cutting issues is currently considered to be unsatisfactory. At the time of writing, no attention was paid to gender equality, though it is noted that steps are being taken to improve how gender is mainstreamed under the Montreal Protocol. The document review found almost no evidence that monitoring and evaluation outputs include attention to cross-cutting issues (see also KPI 2).<br>Although intervention designs satisfactorily incorporated realistic measures to ensure sustainability, M&E documents were found not to explicitly examine the critical assumptions which underpin sustainability. This could be an important area for improvement. It is noted, however, that the 83rd meeting of the Executive Committee (2019) approved the terms of reference for a desk study on the sustainability of the achievements of the Montreal Protocol.<br>MLF has suitable procedures in place to track the speed of intervention, although it does not appear to benchmark it – neither internally nor externally. It is noted that the 82nd meeting of the Executive Committee (2018) had discussed concerns regarding a large number of delays in project implementation under the Protocol and led to decision 84/85 on the cancellation of multi-year agreements. Documents reviewed during this assessment period found limited analysis from MLF on causes of delays or steps taken to address them, although such analysis has been carried out in the past.

    'value': 'On the whole, TC interventions are member state demand-driven, national government-centric and developed in partnership with the clients. UNCTAD has hitherto participated, or is still actively participating, in the formulation of 37 Common Country Analysis as well as related narrative parts of UNSDCFs during the design phase. Although UNCTAD does not have country strategies itself, its TC member states must articulate how UNCTAD’s TC would contribute to their national development strategies. The large percentage of locally (self-) funded projects under ASYCUDA and DMFAS are an indication of successful alignment of TC to the needs and priorities of the member states. Evaluations show that under each subprogramme, UNCTAD’s TC meets the needs of its target constituents. The relevance of technical assistance interventions is rated highly.<br>Context analysis and partner capacity analysis are compulsory elements of the appraisal process of new requests for TC, and guidelines on what is needed, have been developed. A basic capacity analysis is required as part of the stakeholder analysis and is one of the ten minimum requirements for results-based management. In practice, the depth of the analysis differs from project to project. Although respondents to the partner survey spoke appreciatively of these, the review of a sample of 60 documents of projects carried out in the surveyed countries shows a mixed picture. In some cases, context analysis was included; in others, especially the older projects, this was not the case. There was limited evidence of reflection points with partners.<br>Risk management for TC is an emergent practice at UNCTAD. At the level of TC interventions, risk assessments are required; however, these are not broken down into the four risk categories (operational, strategic, political and reputational). Interviews indicate that ensuring that staff comply with UN rules and regulations is a work in progress; until recently, no such system existed. Survey respondents appreciate UNCTAD’s risk management, with 90% giving positive ratings. This is in contrast with the analysis from the project sample from the same countries, where only limited evidence was found of a risk framework, identification or consideration of risk in the project descriptions and logframes.<br>With the exception of economic governance, which is integral to most TC interventions, and gender mainstreaming, there is little evidence to suggest that other cross-cutting issues (environmental sustainability and climate change, and respect for human rights) are consistently included in the design of TC interventions.<br>Many TC interventions aim to strengthen existing national systems. Sustainability – in the sense that the benefits of the project are expected to continue after its completion – is part of the project document design template. In practice, results are mixed. While evaluations found evidence of good practice or some likelihood of sustainability of the TC interventions they had examined, stronger national ownership and engagement, as well as adopting a programmatic rather than project approach, were nevertheless recommended. Moreover, sustainability pathways are not clearly articulated in project documents; nor were they clearly expressed by staff during interviews. Given the large number of one-off interventions, sustainability is not always an integral consideration in project design.<br>UNCTAD’s institutional procedures are efficient and allow for swift action. Still, UN Secretariat processes and instruments are not always well appreciated by staff. Umoja is seen as cumbersome and rigid, despite recent improvements. The introduction and use of the dashboard, UNCTAD’s management information system, has increased internal efficiency, transparency and communication. Seventy per cent of implementing partners state that organisational procedures do not cause them delays.',

    'value': 'Operational guidance requires UNIDO’s interventions to align with country priorities and results. In the main this is observed, although there are instances where projects are not well aligned. This is more often the case when projects are initiated by HQ without due reference to field staff and countries. Projects are not always aligned with country programmes or their results frameworks, reflecting the challenge of relying on earmarked funding (see MI 1.4). The move to the PCP model is beginning to increase alignment with country priorities but is still a work in progress. Analysis of context and capacity is variable and sometimes weak, reflecting a lack of tools, resources and capacity for diagnostics; new tools and training are being developed. Capacity building is undertaken in practice but is not clearly defined within project design and review. National/project steering committees of national institutions and counterparts, relevant UN agencies and donors meet regularly to review progress and identify any necessary adjustments.<br>Analysis and reporting of cross-cutting issues are not all well addressed. Environment is the exception and is clearly identified in both UNIDO analysis and monitoring, as many projects address the environment or energy use. Projects do not consistently explicitly address gender within the intervention design or reporting. Governance and human rights are not articulated within guidance on contextual analysis, although in practice both issues are to some extent addressed. UNIDO does not have a well-articulated definition or conceptualisation of sustainability and the assumptions that underpin it, and sustainability for individual projects is often not well identified at the outset. Sustainability of industrial development policies supported by UNIDO is not articulated or measured, and as a result, governments do not always give UNIDO due credit for its support and interventions.<br>Systematic and consistent risk analysis and mitigation procedures have only relatively recently been introduced to UNIDO. There is no standard approach to risk analysis, mitigation or reporting. Levels of appetite for risk and risk mitigation approaches are not defined and are still work in progress. A Risk Management Committee and workplan to develop risk management have been established (2017), and the Audit Advisory Committee has also been providing advice on risk management. <br>At present there is no systematic assessment of speed of project implementation. There are project delays due both to UNIDO management and to government and contextual factors. UNIDO’s highly centralised model, combined with multiple layers of accountability and a lack of delegated authority to the UR/UCR, is a continuing obstacle to timely decision-making at the field level. Evidence from evaluations of country programmes indicates that procedural delays are a significant challenge; improvements to finance systems and to procurement have recently been introduced.',

    'value': 'Country programmes tend to be well aligned with national priorities, and regional programmes largely address regional priorities. It is also the case that some global and thematic programmes with country- and regional-level implementation activities are very well aligned with regional and national priorities. Global programmes facilitate adaptable links to the normative dimensions in UNODC‘s mandate. They are a flexible and timely vehicle to reflect the UNODC’s multifaceted mandates and respond to member states’ needs. <br>However, largely because there is little scrutiny over the scope of global programmes and because there are informal incentives for staff to attract donor funding, some global and thematic interventions are designed with insufficient attention to local needs or priorities, and there is scope for duplication.<br>UNODC’s country programming documents contain contextual analysis that influences the design and implementation of interventions – and these do reflect the inputs of stakeholders. Global and regional programmes, largely because of the broader target context, are weaker on contextual analysis. In terms of cross-cutting issues, they do address gender and governance issues but are not required to address the environment or climate change.<br>Capacity analysis informs intervention design and implementation, and strategies to address any weakness found are employed to some degree. Given that global and regional programmes address the capacity of disparate stakeholders, it is impractical to expect detailed capacity analysis for all target recipients. UNODC uses e-learning and issues specialist toolkits to assist its face-to-face capacity-building support. An evaluation of UNODC’s capacity building found evidence of both positive practice and weaknesses.<br>UNODC is strengthening its treatment of risk at all levels. It follows the UN Secretariat’s guidance on Enterprise Risk Management and has implemented its policies since 2014. All its regional offices have developed comprehensive risk registers, as have global programmes and all programme interventions. Field offices and country programmes are beginning to develop risk registers. UNODC risk registers address strategic, political and operational risk, and reputational risk.<br>Intervention designs include the analysis of gender equality and human rights as cross-cutting issues and of governance as a key contextual factor. As noted in MI 2.1d, UNODC has only recently spelt out its policy on gender mainstreaming, so it is likely that its inclusion in intervention designs will be stronger in future.<br>UNODC’s interventions include both normative/standard-setting programmes and country-level programmes. Much of UNODC’s normative work by its very nature is aimed at delivering sustainable change. UNODC’s support to countries to implement international conventions and related protocols is aimed at securing sustained capability to deliver an enabling policy or legal environment; its interventions also seek to ensure partner governments or agencies have the capability to deliver these normative standards indefinitely. UNODC carries out this role with respect to a broad range of conventions and protocols (see KPI 1). Its ability to support reform processes using its regular budget in all jurisdictions is limited by resource constraints; but where extrabudgetary funds have been committed, it has been able to provide consistent and targeted support. The challenges of building sustained capability are more difficult, and UNODC has a mixed record in this regard – though all intervention designs address this challenge.<br>The assessment finds there is mixed evidence on whether institutional procedures support or hinder the speed of implementation. UNODC’s integrated implementation systems are relatively proven and mature – they have been used to implement many high-volume programmes – both in HQ and in country contexts. However, evaluations and interviews indicate that there is room for improvement, particularly in procurement. A significant number of interviewees considered that UNODC needs to improve its institutional procedures by modernising and streamlining its administrative and management systems.',

    'value': 'The Montreal Protocol does not produce regional strategies, but individual projects and multi-year agreements can be considered country strategies – given their explicit focus on helping non-Article 5 countries comply with their obligation under the Protocol.<br>Reviewed policy documents at the global level suggest how the implementation of the Montreal Protocol is conducted in reference to national strategies and objectives. The Consolidated Text of the Montreal Protocol (2016) mandates that “resources under the Multilateral Fund shall be disbursed with the concurrence of the beneficiary Party”. The MLF Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria’s Financial Mechanism chapter (2017) describes the intention for a country-driven implementation of the Montreal Protocol. This policy document states that “the Executive Committee at its Thirty-third Meeting … reached a consensus on the need for a country-driven approach, allowing countries to retain the flexibility to determine the type of approach that would best enable Article 5 countries to meet their obligations under the Montreal Protocol”. The MLF Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria’s Country Programme chapter (2017) states that “the Executive Committee attaches great importance to an effective national strategy in the efforts of the Article 5 countries to comply with their obligations under the Montreal Protocol”. IAs are required to involve national bodies in project identification (Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria. 9. Project Proposals, 2017). <br>HQ staff described how the MLF produces operational guidelines regarding how countries can access funds and what types of projects are eligible. These interviews also described how NOUs tended to have low capacity, creating an imbalance of power with IAs. An effort has been made to rebalance this dynamic and to give countries a more active role in phase-out. Countries are able to decide how fast they wish to reduce and phase out a given chemical – thus generating estimated levels of funding. The MLF negotiates what is eligible for the envelope of funds. Once this is decided on, funding tranches are established – these tranches then determine the business plan. <br>As all interventions funded by the MLF have an explicit focus on helping Article 5 parties comply with their obligations under the Montreal Protocol, there is a direct link between national goals and the goals of an intervention funded under the Protocol. <br>The MLF Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria’s Project Proposals chapter (2017) suggests that structures are in place for IA technical staff to invest time and effort in aligning with national goals. This document states that “the Implementing Agency will establish the necessary contacts with the Article 5 country concerned and elaborate the project documentation to meet all the necessary requirements”. MLF project design procedures and guidelines are intended to guide MLF and IA staff to ensure all interventions support national goals and respect compliance. An HQ interview suggested that once chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were phased out, the decision was made to shift attention to projects with a greater focus on national-level outcomes.',

    'value': 'On the whole, interventions are member state demand-driven, national government-centric and developed in partnership with the clients. UNCTAD states that its operations delivered in the context of the UNDAFs and their successor, the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks (UNCSDFs) are aligned with national strategic objectives of member states. UNCTAD actively participates in the formulation of several Common Country Analysis (CCAs) as well as related narrative parts of these UNSDCFs during the design phase. Evidently, working closely in the context of CCAs and UNCSDFs has the potential for a strong alignment with national priorities. In the Development Account-funded projects, national priorities are well considered. However, these constitute only a small percentage of the overall TC resources.<br>UNCTAD does not create standalone country strategies though project objectives are expected to align with government requests/requirements. For example, the Angola Train for Trade II programme clearly references the government’s strategic framework relevant to the initiative. Since 2016, the appraisal of new requests for TC explicitly requires member states to articulate how UNCTAD TC would contribute to their national development strategies. Prior to that, this was not the case.<br>The high percentage of locally (self-) funded projects under ASYCUDA and DMFAS are an indication of successful alignment of TC to the needs and priorities of the member states. About 70% of ASYCUDA projects are now funded out of national budget; the remaining 30% are contributed by donors (World Bank, European Union, GIZ and others). This trend is increasing.<br>Evaluations show that under each subprogramme, UNCTAD products − including TC − meet the needs of its target constituents. The relevance of technical assistance interventions in particular was rated highly. For instance, a survey conducted for the evaluation of subprogramme 2 found that 93% of respondents from the LDCs, SIDSs, LLDCs and other structurally weak, vulnerable and small economies indicated that technical assistance implemented under this subprogramme was “well adapted to their particular situation and needs”. The evaluation of subprogramme 5 noted that its programme portfolio could be rebalanced towards increased TC, in order to better meet the needs and expectations of its stakeholders.<br>Survey responses suggest that TC projects are designed and implemented to fit with national programmes; two-thirds of respondents give UNCTAD either a very good or excellent score. Based on the review of a sample of TC projects in the surveyed countries, many of which pre-date the 2016 requirement, the evidence is mixed, with some projects explicitly referencing national strategies and goals, and others less so.',

    'value': 'UNIDO country programmes refer clearly to country priorities and objectives. Consultation with national stakeholders to ensure full alignment with national/regional priorities is required by the programme and project formulation and approval process. Field offices and HQ are responsible for ensuring that any new initiative is aligned with national priorities at the project identification stage. URs/UCRs work closely with the country line ministries to ensure alignment, to agree prioritisation of UNIDO activities, and to gain the government’s agreement and sign off.<br>For countries both with and without a country programme, there have been examples of HQ project managers promoting projects which were not well aligned with country objectives and systems, without prior dialogue with country offices and government. In these cases there have often been delays and difficulties with implementation; these instances have decreased over time, reflecting the shift to more strategic working. Such instances tend to be project driven by donors/funding availability, rather than by government requests. For instance in Bangladesh, an IFI proposed loans for a fisheries programme and for livestock and dairy. UNIDO has expertise in these two areas, so nominated itself to be the implementing agency for both, but neither were key sectors for support in the country programme. Often, regional approaches are missing and hence alignment is suboptimal. Funding is often allocated country by country, which weakens UNIDO’s capacity for supporting regional approaches.<br>Country programmes and PCPs link their results frameworks to national objectives. The level of detail and the approach taken vary. Often UNIDO’s country reporting template is very high level, and it is not clear how interventions’ contributions to it are assessed. Country programmes, while well aligned as documents, do not necessarily guide the selection of projects, so that projects may be less well aligned with priorities. A further challenge is that projects are very varied and that each project has its own results framework; aggregating across these to a country level would not necessarily give meaningful information. With the introduction of the 2019 IRPF and UNIDO’s stated intent to transition to a results-based approach, country-based reporting may become clearer and more consistent in future.<br>PCPs receive development funds, which enables PCPs to be well aligned with national objectives; comparable funding is not available to country programmes. UNIDO Representatives/country representatives working in countries without PCPs only receive funding related to projects, limiting their resources for structured engagement with national entities and analysis, although some are successful in sourcing some additional funds. Regional chiefs face similar challenges in their lack of staff and funding for travel for strategic engagement.',

It is also the case that some global and thematic programmes with country- and regional-level implementation activities are very well aligned with regional and national priorities.

Thus, interviews indicate that some global and regional programmes are designed and implemented without enough reference to country needs. Some global programmes were set to deliver country-level interventions without adequate co-ordination with existing interventions or priorities. Programmes do set out the context in their intervention design documents and, to the extent possible, use state or other monitoring data to assess results. <br>There is documentary evidence that interventions are aligned with national/regional priorities and with intended national/regional results. Reviewed country or regional strategies do consistently refer to national/regional strategies or objectives. Six country documents, chosen as a representative sample, refer to national strategies and the contribution that the intervention will make to achieving their objectives. <br>The UNODC Programme and Operations Manual states that regional programmes should meet regional needs but should also be based on country-level needs – though there does not seem to be a requirement to consult those responsible for country strategies. The Regional Programme for Southeast Asia 2014-17 is a good example of a strategy that explicitly provides interventions that demand a regional response – dealing with regional drugs and crime challenges that are best addressed through cross-border and intra-regional co-operation. The Mid-term Independent Project Evaluation: Sustainable Livelihoods and Development in Myanmar 2014-2019 notes that “the initiative is fully aligned with the national strategies, UN and donors’ priorities in Myanmar, as well as with the international development frameworks, including the SDGs”. Interviews indicate<br>that headquarters-designed global programmes are sometimes not well aligned with national priorities and can cut across existing interventions in specific countries. This lack of co-ordination and alignment was mentioned in several interviews and in one of the stakeholder survey qualitative comments. <br>The reviewed country programmes do tend to link the output matrix or results and monitoring frameworks to national priorities and refer to national priorities in the national development context when possible and appropriate. The treatment of outcomes is weaker. The means of verification that programmes use often refer to government reporting or regional or globally mandated data. UNODC sometimes provides specialist areas of support that are not captured in country or regional strategies (e.g. on counter-terrorism legislation). <br>UNODC has few effective structures and incentives in place for technical staff that allow investment of time and effort in the alignment process beyond the country level. Because there are incentives for staff to attract donor funding, there are very weak de facto incentives for staff who design and implement global and thematic interventions to give sufficient attention to local needs or priorities, and there is scope for duplication.<br>UNODC’s partners who were surveyed were positive about UNODC’s ability to ensure its interventions are appropriate to the context: 22% considered that UNODC is “excellent” at ensuring interventions fit national programmes and results, and 45% considered this “very good”.',

    'value': 'UNODC does not have a dedicated, office-specific policy statement on environmental sustainability and climate change. As it is a UN Office, UNODC subscribes to UN-wide policies on environmental sustainability and climate change. UNODC is a member of the UN Environment Management Group, and the Issue Management Group on Sustainability Management in the UN System. The group created the new Strategy for Sustainability Management in the UN System 2020-2030, adopted by the UN in May 2019. In September of the same year, a new Climate Action Plan for the UN Secretariat was released. However, both policies are too recent for evidence of their implementation within UNODC to apply to this assessment. UNODC subscribes to the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, three of which relate to the environment. <br> Although the UN policy was only put in place in 2019, some of UNODC’s programmes do support sustainability. Its Alternative Development interventions, which promote alternatives to illicit crop cultivation, contribute to the prevention of forest degradation. They contribute to the preservation and sustainable use of natural resources through land stabilisation projects and by helping to build resilience in communities affected by climate change. UNODC’s Global Wildlife and Forest Crime Programme also contributes to environmental sustainability by addressing threats to biodiversity – supporting efforts to combat illegal logging, wildlife poaching and trafficking, and fisheries crime and corruption. It works with a network of over 40 countries and seeks to build international consensus to tackle the illegal exploitation of natural resources.<br>Environmental sustainability and climate change indicators and targets are not yet integrated into the organisation’s strategic plan and corporate objectives. UNODC’s operational environmental footprint is reported under UNOV’s submission on the UN’s Greening the Blue website. Figures submitted only appear to cover its core activities and not programmatic activities outside of its Vienna headquarters. <br>UNODC does not yet have environmental sustainability screening checklists or comparable tools for new interventions. <br>Human and financial resources are not committed to addressing environmental sustainability and climate change issues outside the specific programmes mentioned above. There are no dedicated positions in UNODC working solely on these issues. <br>UNODC does not conduct specific staff capacity development on environmental sustainability and climate change. <br>The scores against the elements in this micro-indicator reflect UNODC’s absence of a formal policy or supporting framework – though, as noted above, there is now an overarching Secretariat policy which should frame its future policy.',

    'value': 'CGIAR has no dedicated policy statement on good governance and effective institutions. There is a statement and set of principles outlined in the Partnerships and Development Strategy in the SRF document, as partnerships are integral to promoting CGIAR’s development outcomes at scale. This commitment is expressed in various other high-level documents and prominently on the CGIAR website. The business plan states clearly the central importance of diverse partnerships and CGIAR reported more than 1 500 active external partnerships in 2017, ranging from long-standing to innovative new partnerships for adoption at individual, community, sub-regional, national and international levels at scale. However, evaluations (both System-wide and at CRP level) and some interviews note variability in the effectiveness of partnership strategies in place at CRP level, as well as a degree of opportunism rather than strategic analysis in the selection of partnerships. <br>Institutional effectiveness, partnership and development indicators are fully integrated into CGIAR’s SRF. The CGIAR SRF includes a commitment to a clear focus on strengthening the policy and institution enabling environment and on developing the capacity of national partners and beneficiaries. The two relevant cross-cutting themes are underpinned by a further four outcome areas each. Enabling policies and institutions (good governance) is further set out as one of eight research priorities. The accountability system is substantially implemented. CRPs report against the relevant SRF indicators and the relevant SLO, and partnerships is one of the Common Results Reporting indicators. All partnerships are recorded, providing information on the types and volume of partnerships, although the relative strategic importance of certain partnerships, their effectiveness, how partners benefit and how integration can be improved are not captured.<br>In new interventions, there is a requirement that all POWBs make clear their plans to work with partners. However, evaluations and some interviews note that there is no requirement for a distinct partnership strategy, strategic analysis of partners or operational partnership plan from CRPs, which leads to some of the variability and inconsistencies already noted. <br>Evaluative evidence and interviews indicate that the resources and funding base for partnerships has been unstable, short-term and fragmented. Human resources to support partnerships in CRPs are under-resourced. There is no evident connection between the resources concentrated in the PIM platform and partnerships/capacity building, although both focus on the enabling environment. The capacity development of staff on the principles of good partnership development is under-resourced, according to the 2017 evaluation of Capacity Development. Some CRPs provide training and resources, and there is a Capacity Development Community of Practice (CD CoP), whose significant contributions to good practice is recognised in evaluations. However, the CD CoP itself is under-resourced.',

    'value': 'In accordance with the Inception Report, it was agreed to interpret this cross-cutting issue as “policies / practices that promote economic governance as a cross-cutting issue across all TC programmes and projects”.<br>Enhancing economic good governance is a critical programmatic area and implicit in relation to UNCTAD’s mandate. The Nairobi Maafikiano as well as subsequent programme and budget proposals states that UNCTAD will “[g]ive due account to cross-cutting issues such as good governance at all levels…and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies, which are essential to all countries to attain sustainable and equitable growth and development” (p. 4). The TC Toolbox results frameworks also explicitly reference the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda directly linked to UNCTAD’s core mandate: SDGs 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16 and 17. In addition, they describe the long-term impact of “[t]ackling vulnerabilities, improving resilience; fostering economic efficiency, improving governance”.<br>Arguably, therefore, the main objective and raison d’être of UNCTAD’s TC is to enhance economic governance by putting in place or strengthening country systems, in accordance with the common principles listed in the Busan partnership document, namely national ownership of development priorities; a focus on results; recognition of the diversity and complementarity of development partners; transparency and shared responsibility.<br>Nevertheless, UNCTAD does not apply a clear definition or explicit economic governance strategy, which interviewees attribute to the controversial debate between member states surrounding the concept of good (economic) governance. Interviews demonstrated that while economic governance is at the heart of much of what UNCTAD does, it is not framed as such. Interviews also suggested that different perspectives coexisting within an organisation were to be expected, given the think tank role of UNCTAD, although some staff raised concerns that the sometimes contradictory or controversial materials being presented by the organisation might undermine UNCTAD’s overall voice.<br>Although the project clearance checklist for all new TC interventions does not specify governance, many TC programmes and projects in fact do include an explicit objective to improve economic policy and strengthen the capacity of relevant government institutions. For instance, the DMFAS programme’s long-term objective (impact) is one whereby “[g]overnments manage their debt effectively and sustainably, in support of poverty reduction, development and good governance” (p. 15). Short-term outputs are described in terms of “increased institutional capacity of countries to enhance their accounting and reporting, corporate transparency, governance and accountability” (p. 27).<br>At the level of the five subprogrammes, but more so at the level of individual projects and programmes, indicators of enhanced economic governance capacity are included in plans and reported against. <br>Staff regard supporting and strengthening economic governance as a given part of the work; therefore, no specific resources are dedicated to it. UNCTAD events and training also include a focus on improving governance.<br>Despite the fact that UNCTAD’s economic governance policy and strategy are implicit, rather than explicit, survey responses indicate that member states are familiar with it: 54% of the respondents claimed to know it well or by a fair amount; 37% knew a little to almost nothing, and 5% had not heard of it yet.',

    'value': 'UNIDO does not have an explicit policy statement on how it intends to strengthen good governance through its work, and interviewees indicated that the term is not applied or understood in a consistent manner across the organisation. <br>Two of UNIDO’s strategic priorities are “creating shared prosperity” and “advancing economic competitiveness”. The MTPF describes how “[i]ndustrial and economic policies need to be designed in a way that distributes benefits in an inclusive way” and indicates that “[i]nclusiveness is essential to realize the developmental potential of industries, decrease income inequality, and strengthen social cohesion, both in developed and developing countries”. An interviewee at HQ expressed the opinion that “supporting national good governance is essential otherwise [supporting industrial transformation] is not sustainable and we waste our money”. Some interviewees suggested that UNIDO’s capacity building work with governmental line ministries is a contribution to good governance but that good governance work in general is not one of UNIDO’s “mainstream activities”. <br>Indicators and targets related to the principles of good governance and effective institutions feature to some extent in UNIDO’s IRPF but not explicitly; under Tier 1 Level 2 (country and global results with UNIDO ISID support) of the 2019 IRPF, there are indicators on shared prosperity as well as on “partnerships, governance and institutional coordination”.  These include for example “number and rate of people integrated into the formal labour market as a result of UNIDO intervention” and “number of firms reporting access to productive assets” for the former, and “number of actors participating in enhanced collaboration settings (clusters, networks etc.) as a result of UNIDO interventions” and “number of inter-ministerial or multi-stakeholder co-ordination mechanisms established as a result of UNIDO interventions” for the latter. <br>Some accountability systems within UNIDO reflect principles of good governance and effective institutions, for example a Policy on Business Sector Partnerships stipulates that UNIDO complies in its technical assistance operations with strict governance standards and expects prospective business sector partners to adhere to the same standards as part of its accountability. Governance is becoming an increasing issue for sustainability of interventions within the PCP, as these are based on the notion of economic transformation and without good governance this is impossible. UNIDO’s Evaluation Manual also presents some suggested and sample questions to help formulate questions for evaluating UNIDO projects’ and programmes’ sustainability through a good governance lens. These include:<br>Do the legal frameworks, policies, and governance structures and processes within which the project operates pose risks that may jeopardise the sustainability of project benefits?<br>Are requisite systems for accountability and transparency and required technical know-how in place?<br>While there is no documented, explicit requirement to assess governance issues in new interventions, UNIDO does consider whether government requests for support align to the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), and also undertake analysis to avoid projects that end up being self-serving or fostering corruption. Staff at HQ explained that they look for evidence that needs of beneficiaries are being addressed in project designs and that there is coherence between project inputs and outputs to avoid inflated budgets and resource diversion. Policy also stipulates that due diligence screening on governance standards and conduct should be conducted on prospective partners of UNIDO.<br>There are no dedicated human resources to address issues of good governance in UNIDO, although there are some indirect financial resources. Major Programme C of the Programme and Budget 2018-2019 covers UNIDO’s thematic priorities, specifically C.1 for “Creating shared prosperity” and C.2 for “Advancing economic competitiveness”. These are also covered in the 2020-21 Programme and Budget which indicates there has been a minor increase in the resources for C.1 “Creating shared prosperity”. <br>No evidence of capacity development of staff on good governance was found per se. The IRPF contains indicators under Level 4 (organisational effectiveness and modernisation) on alignment of training with UNIDO priorities, looking specifically at the percentage of training courses allocated to technical skills upgrading in (a) industrial competitiveness and innovations; (b) industrial human resources and gender equality; (c) industrial governance; (d) environmental footprints of industries; and (e) others related to SDG 9.',

    'value': 'Given its mandate and operational focus, UNODC has the structures and mechanisms to support the implementation of global frameworks for cross-cutting issues relating to good governance. This is a strength. UNODC’s core mandate concerns promoting good governance. It aims to help countries “foster good governance, robust criminal justice systems that observe human rights, security sector reform and, consequently, also sustainable development, through strengthening states’ capacities to prevent, confront and defeat transnational organized crime”. In terms of its priority governance areas, UNODC focuses on countering transnational organised crime; combatting drug use; countering corruption; terrorism prevention; and justice. Sixty percent of survey respondents consider that UNODC’s promotion of good governance is “excellent” or “very good”; while 62% hold the same views with respect to its work in promoting human rights. A high proportion of UNODC’s stakeholders surveyed were more aware of UNODC’s approach to good governance: 57% stated they know it very well or know a fair amount about it. <br>Using its work to combat organised crime as just one example, UNODC supports states to build their capacities to prevent, investigate and prosecute organised crime by providing technical assistance to develop crime prevention strategies and build capacities for investigation and prosecution, including training staff of law enforcement, customs and border agencies, prosecutorial offices, the judiciary, financial intelligence units and other related officials; it promotes and strengthens international co-operation in criminal matters among law enforcement officials, judicial practitioners and other relevant actors through a variety of mechanisms, including through <br>regional and inter-regional networks and anti-organised crime units, and the development of software tools and databases to share information. UNODC drives cutting-edge work in several areas – its work on cyber-crime and terrorism are highlights. <br>Good governance indicators and targets are integrated into the organisation’s strategic plan and corporate objectives as part of results frameworks for UNODC’s nine subprogrammes. Because all UNODC’s subprogrammes are essentially focused on improving governance UNODC’s accountability systems (including corporate reporting and evaluation), they reflect good governance indicators and targets throughout.<br>UNODC does not use specific checklists, nor should this be expected because each of its interventions operates in specific sub-sectors relating to good governance. Outcomes are designed to improve governance. It has produced toolkits and checklists that both its own staff and global partners can use in designing specific good governance interventions. For example, it has produced toolkits for assessing criminal justice systems, programming support to women’s access to justice, and combatting migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons. <br>Most of UNODC’s human and financial resources are directed at addressing good governance issues: its budgets demonstrate this financial commitment. UNODC has an eLearning programme that is a resource to build the governance capacity of staff and member state personnel alike. Its Global eLearning Programme contains over 400 modules covering governance issues such as wildlife crime, transnational organised crime, illicit drugs, tracking in persons and smuggling of migrants, and issues relating to border control, forensic investigations, controlled deliveries, security and travel documents, and intelligence analysis.',

    'value': 'There is no dedicated policy statement on human rights. However, CGIAR Research Centers that host genebanks have legal treaty obligations within the ITPGRFA to protect and promote farmers’ rights within their approach to conserving and making available a global resource of germplasm from crops and trees. The Intellectual Asset Management Principles make specific reference to the treaty and farmers’ rights. Further, the principles state that they are intended to be “consistent with fundamental human rights as stated in particular in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other relevant international treaties.” There was only a limited proportion of survey respondents who rated CGIAR’s performance on human rights as excellent or very good (only around a quarter).<br>There are no dedicated indicators for farmers’ rights. The SRF captures a high-level commitment to the poorest farmers producers and consumers in three SLOs with many underlying development outcomes and targets. Farmers’ rights are implicit in two of the sub-IDOs: “Increased conservation and use of genetic resources” and “More productive and equitable management of natural resources”. Farmers’ rights are also implicit in the research priority around enabling policies and institutions: “increase the agency and resilience of poor people”; there is also a mention in the SRF of “ensuring that local people control and manage local resources.” <br>The lack of any explicit indicators means that the protection and promotion of farmers’ rights are not tracked through accountability systems at the level of the CGIAR System. However, as a minimum, distribution of germplasm to different categories of users, including farmers and individuals, is reported by the Genebank Platform in the 2017 Annual Performance Report. <br>There are no screening checklists for farmers’ rights, although the CGIAR Principles on the Management of Intellectual Assets are accompanied by a set of Implementation Guidelines (2013). These set out how Research Centers should approach protecting and promoting farmers’ rights, e.g. complying with applicable national laws or work to promote rights if there are no laws, including access and benefit sharing laws, associated traditional knowledge, plant variety protection laws, national seed regulations, laws concerning the land, resource and cultural rights of indigenous and/or local peoples, and other laws.<br>In terms of human and financial resources, the Policy Module of the Genebank Platform provides guidance to Research Centers on farmers’ rights, with the platform providing leadership, expertise and resources in the System on this issue. The assessment team does not have any information as to the resources available in CRPs to implement the guidelines mentioned above. Similarly, on capacity development for protecting and promoting farmers’ rights, no information has been identified to date.',

Judging by the documentation and interview results, there is little evidence to show that this has been explicitly operationalised within UNCTAD’s TC. The theme is addressed in the questionnaire in UNCTAD’s Due Diligence framework to assess whether a potential partner may have been complicit in human rights abuses, uses/tolerates forced or compulsory child labour, or has had any violations of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. There are some isolated examples of partnerships that are related to human rights issues. From the sample of projects considered, one project aimed to improve human rights standards.<br>In 2017, UNCTAD’s Evaluation and Monitoring Unit supported the integration of gender and human rights into the revisions (pending approval) for the 2011 UNCTAD evaluation policy in line with the 2016 revised UN Evaluations group norms and standards as well as the principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Still, in its 2016-17 biennial evaluation assessment, the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) identified gaps in the areas of integrating human rights standards into evaluation practice. Moreover, the project clearance checklist makes no reference to human rights.<br>The “UN and Human Rights” is a mandatory course for all UN Secretariat staff members and is available in Inspira.<br>Survey responses indicate that member states are least familiar with UNCTAD’s policy and strategy on respect for human rights: 29% of the respondents claimed to know it well or by a fair amount; 42% knew a little to almost nothing, and 29% had not heard of it.',

    'value': 'The promotion and protection of human rights and security is not explicitly stated as policy and is not integrated into the strategic plan. UNIDO is not explicitly mandated to address human rights; however, human rights considerations are implicit in how UNIDO advocates for ISID as a driving force for economic and social development and poverty elimination but is not developed in terms of analysis or policy. ISID also encompasses equality and social inclusion, particularly for women, or for vulnerable groups such as youth or disadvantaged communities. Documentation (UNIDO’s ESSSP) states that UNIDO seeks to support governments to adhere to their human rights obligations and empower individuals and groups, particularly the most marginalised, to realise their rights and interests and to ensure that they fully participate throughout the development and implementation of projects. Human rights are recognised in UNIDO’s gender strategy and in the ESSPP. <br>There are no explicit target indicators for human rights in UNIDO’s MTPF and IRPF, although the strategic priority “‘creating shared prosperity” in the current MTPF aims to advance poverty eradication and inclusiveness. Under Level 1 (global development results) there are indicators for the international poverty line, though this is not linked to UNIDO support, and under Level 2 (country results with UNIDO ISID support) there are indicators for addressing food security and human security and increased livelihood opportunities in post-crisis situations. These indicators refer to the number of projects addressing the issues rather than being indicators of impact and are therefore not core measures of human rights. <br>Accountability systems within UNIDO only indirectly encompass issues of human rights. One function of the Office of Evaluation and Internal Oversight is to ensure that human rights issues are duly considered in the conduct of evaluation and in evaluation reports. Diligence for partnerships stipulates that “UNIDO shall not engage in, or will disengage from, business partnerships should there be evidence of their involvement in: violation of United Nations sanctions, Security Council resolutions, and international conventions and treaties; sale or manufacture of anti-personnel landmines, cluster bombs, and other weapons and ammunitions; tolerating forced or compulsory labour or the use of child labour; complicity in human rights abuses; and production or sales of tobacco.”<br>UNIDO has deepened its engagement with UN systemic initiatives on human rights. It has participated in the Working Group on Human Rights of the United Nations Development Group, aiding in the elaboration of a Human Rights Based Approach to development. UNIDO has also been implementing various United Nations systemic initiatives with regard to human rights including “Human Rights Up Front”. UNIDO’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Programme is part of the UN Global Compact, guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights of Work, the Rio Declaration and the Convention Against Corruption.<br>Some screening mechanisms for new interventions address human rights issues; five of UNIDO’s ten programmatic operational safeguards relate to human rights as do two of their framework operational safeguards. Also in trade, a diagnostic approach is built in to look at disadvantaged groups since infrastructure investments can cause many conflicts of interest.<br>There are no explicit and dedicated human and financial resources for looking at human rights within UNIDO. In the past, the General Conference of UNIDO requested mobilisation of adequate financial resources from new and additional multilateral funds, including for human security, to<br>finance its activities in post-crisis situations. The agriculture department now has a fulltime staff in HQ looking at human security issues integration across the portfolio. <br>No evidence of capacity development of staff on human rights was found in UNIDO.',

    'value': 'UNODC’s mandate is in the security and justice sector, and it has a responsibility to safeguard human rights as well as promote them. UNODC reports against the UN’s Human Rights Due Diligence Policy that relates to UN Support to Non-UN Security Forces (HRDDP) – and did so in 2017, contributing to the 2018 review. The Human Rights Due Diligence Policy sets out measures that all UN entities must take to ensure any support they provide is consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. It was among the entities that “have taken significant steps in progressing implementation through advisory groups, SOPs [standard operating procedures], task <br>forces and the development of related tools and guidance”. UNODC has systems and procedures that aim to embed the UN’s Human Rights Due Diligence Policy i.e. to ensure to ensure its interventions safeguard human rights. However, some interviewees considered that, in practice, these might not be implemented systematically across the organisation. <br>UNODC works in the security sector with law enforcement agencies that in some countries could be associated with human rights abuses; it also has a mandate to provide capabilities that could be abused to harm human rights. There is thus a greater onus on UNODC that it “does no harm” than on multilateral organisations not involved in the security sector. A 2012 position paper sets out the relevance of international human rights standards to UNODC’s mandate and the relationship between UNODC drug control, crime prevention, criminal justice mandates, and human rights obligations and standards. It identifies how programme staff should be aware of the ways human rights could be supported or compromised in these areas and gives practical advice. <br>There is evidence that the policy is implemented – both in UNODC’s submission to a 2018 report on entities’ compliance with the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy on UN Support to Non-UN Security Forces (HRDDP) and on the UN’s HRDDP report itself, which appraises UNODC’s submission. UNODC has established a Human Rights Advisory Group, composed of UNODC senior managers from all divisions. It is tasked with advising the Executive Director on structures, tools and procedures required to mainstream human rights at headquarters and in the field. UNODC reports that its Human Rights Advisory Group regularly assesses programmes for HRDDP compliance and launched a guidance tool to assess human rights risks in programme planning in 2017 (superseding a 2014 Human Rights Risk Assessment tool). UNODC states that its Programme Review Committee ensures that all programmes comply with human rights-related requirements through its Human Rights Advisory Group, which addresses HRDDP implementation and provides advice to UNODC’s Executive Director. Two interviewees were not confident that, in practice, scrutiny was undertaken as consistently or as robustly as necessary, and they were concerned that some interventions in sensitive areas could progress without enough scrutiny. This assessment did not have the scope to examine the extent to which these concerns were justified and simply noted these views.<br>UNODC also delivers human rights risk mitigation measures in its programmes. For example, the Office is mandated to promote the application of UN standards and norms with respect to the UN Standard Minimum Rules on the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules), the UN Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid or the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.<br>Human rights indicators and targets are not listed in UNODC’s strategic plan and corporate objectives as discrete indicators or targets, but objectives to respect and enhance human rights are mainstreamed into each thematic area in UNODC. For example, each thematic area explicitly considers human-rights related developments in the 2017 annual report. UNODC programmes/projects on crime prevention and criminal justice reform include performance indicators that allow for measuring issues related to human rights compliance. <br>Human rights risks and mitigation are included in the UNODC programming cycle (strategy setting – programme development – resource mobilisation implementation and monitoring – evaluation). Programme/project documents are required to include background evidence on human rights to determine the human rights-related effects of proposed activities, as well as information on risks and risk mitigation strategies; the project document template is particularly explicit on its treatment of human rights. Performance reviews are conducted, including on human rights issues, for example through the submission of Annual Programme Progress Reports. Evaluations also analyse the human rights impact of interventions, in line with UNODC’s Evaluation Policy. <br>UNODC staff are requested to use human rights screening checklists for all new interventions. A 2018 guidance note instructs staff on how to assess whether actions improve state capacity, observance and fulfilment of human rights. As noted above, some interviewees expressed concern that not all potentially sensitive interventions receive the degree of scrutiny that UNODC’s policy requires. <br>Given that several core programmes address human rights issues, dependent on extrabudgetary funding, resources to support human rights are available. To raise staff awareness at the headquarters level, UNODC has developed an e-learning module on human rights on the work of UNODC, which includes extensive reference to the HRDDP, as well as exercises and case studies. This complements mandatory training on UN Human Rights Responsibilities.',

The MLF Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria’s Country Programme chapter (2017) sets out the following requirements for the country programme documentation:<br>• “[a] review of recent production, imports, applications and use of controlled substances by the main producers, users, and consumers, and links to transnational producers or users (if information is available)<br>• a description of the institutional framework governing controlled substances (government agencies, non-governmental organisations [NGOs], consumer groups, industry associations)<br>a description of the policy framework and of regulatory and incentive systems.<br>The MLF obliges interventions funded by the Montreal Protocol to provide a statement that positions them within the operating context. The MLF Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria’s Project Proposals chapter (2017) requires that a project document contain information such as sector data, implementation arrangements, institutional framework and technical appraisal. Specific guidelines, requiring clear statements of operating context, are available for the various intervention types of the Montreal Protocol (e.g. The Updated Guide for the Preparation and Submission of Additional Projects to Demonstrate Climate-Friendly and Energy Efficient Alternative Technologies to HCFCs and Feasibility Studies, 2018). Project documents are developed by IAs, in conjunction with the NOU of the country in question according to a set format.<br>Partners (in this context, NOUs) are involved in the development of context statements. The MLF Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria’s Financial Mechanism chapter (2017) suggests NOUs have the flexibility to determine the type of approach that would best enable Article 5 countries to meet their obligations under the Montreal Protocol. IAs are required to involve national bodies in project identification (Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria. 9. Project Proposals, 2017).<br>The 2018 Desk Study for the Evaluation of Gender Mainstreaming in the Montreal Protocol found that gender issues are seldom taken into account in project design. Staff at HQ described how project gender balance does not currently need to be reported to the Executive Committee, but they also stated that the MLF is investigating means of increasing its gender focus in projects. IAs have been invited to consider how they could address gender under the Montreal Protocol, with the intention that this would be presented to the 84th meeting of the Executive Committee (2019). <br>Project proposal templates require submitting detailed information on climate and environmental impacts. Management structures and institutional responsibility for M&E are mentioned in the guidelines for project proposals, as well as in the agreements between governments and the Executive Committee. In addition, the existence of conflict is taken into account in EXCOM decisions relating to particular countries when relevant, but the analysis of governance issues is less extensive. <br>HQ interviews suggested evidence of reflection points between MLF and partners concerning funds. Partners submit detailed budgets for review by the MLF for every funding tranche request and adjustment (such as a reduction in project funds to make up for a shortfall caused by high administrative costs) as needed. Every project is monitored from beginning to end, with deviations requiring an explanation and a suitable response. All unused, or unneeded, funds are required to be returned – “down to the dollar”. There is some flexibility on how money can be used, but significant changes would require the project/multi-year agreement to be reviewed.',

    'value': 'As part of the project appraisal process, UNCTAD has established procedures for all new TC requests to ensure that context is analysed and that capacity needs and gaps are identified. Interviews highlighted that such analysis is usually undertaken in close collaboration with member states requesting TC assistance.<br>As part of the design phase, the standardised, secretariat-wide project template requires that an analysis is carried out of the core problems addressed by the project, the effects and root causes of these problems including a problem tree, and sustainable solutions to address the root causes. The analysis should draw on findings and recommendations from UNCTAD’s research and consensus-building work. In cases where research and analysis products have been produced, this contributes to a strong understanding of context. UNCTAD’s revised guidelines on results-based management for TC provide further details on how to conduct both the problem analysis and the stakeholder analysis.<br>Gender-disaggregated data should also be used if available. In that regard, UNCTAD’s Checklist for Mainstreaming Gender Equality in TC projects is a helpful tool to assess gender mainstreaming potential and examine points of gender mainstreaming at various stages of the project cycle: project analysis (including gender assessment/differential impacts on women and men and use of gender disaggregated data), definition of the logframe (including gender issues and gender sensitive indicators and baseline), budget, stakeholder’s participation, risk analysis, project monitoring and evaluation (including self-monitoring, progress and final reports, and external evaluations). With the exception of economic governance, there is little evidence to suggest that other cross-cutting issues (environmental sustainability and climate change, and respect for human rights) are consistently included in the context analysis of TC interventions.<br>The Angola Train for Trade II project provides a good practice example of project design. UNCTAD undertook a needs assessment mission that drew on previous research and analysis and included wide and robust consultation with government institutions. It identified five to six broad components and developed the project in line with the principles of results-based management (RBM). Each component has a full logical framework, based on the needs assessment carried out by each of the divisions. The logframes considered risk and assumptions and supported strategy development. As part of project implementation, UNCTAD keeps track of these risks and collects evidence of changes and potential impacts that interventions have on these.<br>Survey results show high levels of appreciation for how projects are designed. Respondents generally agree that interventions are tailored to the needs of the local context and are adaptive to changes therein, although scores from Angolan respondents are lower. The depth of the analysis differs from project to project. The review of a sample of documents of projects carried out in the surveyed countries shows a mixed picture. In some cases, context analysis was included or previously assessed as part of a research and analysis product (e.g. competition and consumer protection, investment policy reviews). Moreover, in the case of DMFAS project documents that were reviewed, the oftentimes longstanding country involvement has contributed to a solid understanding of local context. UNSDCF/UNDAF projects and UN Development Account projects also tend to include well-described context analyses. In others, especially the older projects included in the sample, this was not the case. There was limited evidence of reflection points with partners.',

    'value': 'Contextual analysis is undertaken as part of the project concept note and then in more detail in the project document; this draws on previous knowledge where there are already projects and research data. Interventions are expected to be tailored to context. A small amount of regular budget funding (usually up to EUR 20 000) is available for a Preparatory Assessment (PA) for context analysis. Some donors do not fund inception periods, and UNIDO project managers are then obliged to seek internal funds to ensure the intervention is well aligned with context. These funds are insufficient for all needs, and lack of adequate resources for context analysis is recognised as a challenge and a risk to projects by UNIDO. <br>During the project development (project document stage), UNIDO consults with the relevant ministries to identify any changes needed to make the project work in context. A simplified country diagnostic template was being introduced for PCPs in 2019 so that context analysis can be undertaken by the field office with guidance provided by the Policy Research and Statistics Department. For PCPs, there is a more structured engagement with a range of national and international partners. There is no standard UNIDO inception process model for non-PCP countries. Thus, engagement with a wider range of partners beyond governments is not systematic, although it has improved in recent years. <br>Since 2018, UNIDO has been piloting the use of implementing partners (Project Executing Entities). When it uses these partners, they collaborate on intervention design. <br>Guidelines require context analyses to refer to gender equality issues. Country programmes also refer to gender, although in varied ways, indicating lack of a systematic approach. <br>Country programme strategies reviewed also refer to relevant challenges to integrating environmental sustainability and climate change into country programmes and to issues of political, social and economic fragility, in particular the needs of displaced people, where relevant. <br>Context analyses refer to governance and fragility issues as relevant, for instance displacement of people and security issues which are also relevant to human rights. Context analyses do not routinely refer to other aspects of human rights such as labour rights.<br>In early 2019, the ESSPP were introduced, which set out standards for assessing risks to environ­mental and social issues, including the rights of indigenous people and a process for ensuring compliance. Older, non-GEF projects do not consistently or systematically refer to environment, fragility and governance. The GEF uses its own standards and processes, which has been the basis for much of the ESSPP.<br>Each project has a steering committee of national institutions and counterparts, relevant UN agencies, and donors which meets every six months to review progress and identify any necessary adjustments to the intervention. Country programme and PCPs have similar national steering committees. It is intended that the project safeguards standards using the ESSPP methodology will be reviewed and updated annually for each project.',

    'value': 'UNODC’s country programming documents contain contextual analysis that influences the design and implementation of interventions – and these do reflect the inputs of stakeholders. Regional programmes, largely because of the broader target context, are weaker on contextual analysis. In terms of cross-cutting issues, they do address gender and governance issues but, at the time of this assessment, were not required to address the environment or climate change.<br>The Programme and Operations Manual requires staff to conduct contextual analysis. The manual states that potential interventions must be discussed in the light of the broader UNODC strategy, which provides the binding framework for priority setting, project identification and approval. The <br>sample of six country and regional programmes reviewed do provide descriptions that situate the intervention within the operating context. (The following are those reviewed: Country Programme for Pakistan; Regional Programme for Southeast Asia; Country Programme for Myanmar; Regional Programme for Afghanistan and Neighbouring Countries; Regional Programme for West Africa; Regional Programme for the Arab States.) There is a need to assess, integrate and prioritise programming so that the flexibility and responsiveness of global programmes to member states mesh with the existing country and regional programming. Interviews indicated that global and thematic programmes with implementation at the country level do not take local conditions into account. Interviewees cited several instances in which interventions financed by global programmes were “parachuted” into countries without consultation with the local office, sometimes duplicating existing work, and sometimes inappropriately. <br>Project documents, including analysis, risks, needs and related theories of change and logical framework, are supposed to be drafted based on consultations with partners – comprising both beneficiaries and funding partners). <br>All six country documents reviewed (listed above) address gender equality issues, where relevant. UNODC’s Programme and Operations Manual instructs staff that, as part of the United Nations system, UNODC is obligated “to ensure that a gender perspective is actively and visibly mainstreamed in all its practices, policies and programmes”. According to UNODC’s gender strategy, the Programme Review Committee ensures “the systematic monitoring of the quality of the integration of gender equality into programmes and projects submitted for review”, though the assessment team was unable to find evidence of this. <br>UNODC’s Programme and Operations Manual does not require the treatment of environmental sustainability and climate changes issues. None of the six country documents reviewed (listed above) make direct reference to environmental sustainability and climate changes issues – though alternative livelihood programmes address environmental issues in relation to whether certain crops are likely to be viable alternatives to drug cultivation. <br>UNODC programme documents do treat governance and fragility issues, as one would expect given UNODC’s field of interventions. The situation analysis section of documents reviewed tends to analyse governance and fragility issues within the sectors or issues the programme addresses. For instance, these connections are made in West Africa with respect to natural resources and in Afghanistan with respect to the subversion of good governance and the proliferation of corrupt practices. <br>Agreements with donors stipulate the frequency and nature of reflection points with partners. Significant changes are agreed with funders.',

The MLF also prepares guidelines (available online) for IAs to follow when developing a project. These are shared at inter-agency co-ordination meetings and updated following every Executive Committee meeting. HQ staff described how updates to guidelines are based on “learning by doing” and cumulative precedent. Reviews of MLF guidance and policy documents (such as Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria. 9.

The Secretariat stated that MLF activities always take into account capacities at the national level and frequently at the regional level and that capacity analysis is promoted by the Secretariat during project review.<br>The document review found no requirement from MLF on IAs’ jointly developing capacity analysis statements with NOUs.<br>The document review found no requirement for the production of strategies which address identified weaknesses in capacity.<br>The document review found no specific requirement from the MLF for regular reflection points between IAs and NOUs.

    'value': 'A basic capacity analysis is required as part of the stakeholder analysis and is one of the ten minimum requirements for results-based management. The project document template and project clearance checklist include a Stakeholder Analysis Table, describing the stakeholders (national, regional and/or institutional type and level of involvement in the project (direct/indirect, etc.); their main activities; needs/capacity gaps; and expected benefits from co-ordination with stakeholders. As part of this exercise, project officers must include main actors and other UN institutions − including the UN Country Team, to ensure that there is no duplication of other projects and to highlight potential areas of collaboration.<br>In addition, the organisation has developed guidelines for UNCTAD project managers to assess capacity of implementing partners. This is essentially a screening tool to quickly assess each candidate’s appropriateness and capacity in four functional areas to implement a proposed project: project management; technical skills and resources; financial management; and administrative capacities. These guidelines are not referenced in the project management handbook nor in the Project Clearance Checklist but can be found on the UNCTAD intranet page for Project Documents along with the Due Diligence Checklist<br>Once again, survey respondents are generally positive about UNCTAD’s capacity assessments, with two-thirds giving a score of very good to excellent. Meanwhile, the review of a sample of projects suggest that although project documents will describe the issue (requirements) and what is needed to address it (objective of the project), they do not systematically include a detailed capacity assessment of government partners, nor of the private sector and civil society. In some cases (Angola and Zambia), a detailed, consultative needs assessment is the first step of project implementation. For the Enhanced Integrated Framework Ethiopia and Rwanda E-Commerce and the Digital Economy projects, the detailed capacity assessment is the main project deliverable. In other projects (e.g. Bosnia and Herzegovina, El Salvador and Turkmenistan), there was no reference to a capacity assessment having been conducted. Interviewees point out that changing conditions on the ground have an impact on actual capacity, which is not always factored into the (remote) design. Having staff based in the field allows for ongoing dialogue with partner agencies and a more realistic assessment of their capacities.<br>Based on the project sample, the extent to which the project documents have indeed been developed jointly with the partners is not clear. Moreover, no evidence was found of regular and resourced reflection points.',

It was originally envisaged that a greater proportion of funding for the CRPs would come from Window 1 (W1) and Window 2 (W2) funds. This was not realised, and Research Centers have, as a result, needed to invest greater resources in raising funds to be able to continue to implement programmes. The new FINPLAN aims to address these problems, with a commitment to increase the volume, predictability and stability of available funding for increased sustainability. At the same time, Research Centers have made and continue to make their own decisions around staffing. While there are processes in place to bring greater consistency in performance management systems, the pace of change varies according to the capacity of each of the Research Centers.',

Independent evaluations and interviews with IAs suggest the overall model of the MLF is well-suited to its role and provides an effective structure.<br>Resource mobilisation efforts of the MLF are explicitly aligned to assisting Article 5 countries to meet their obligations under the Protocol. The MLF produces a publicly available consolidated three-year business plan based on the business plans prepared by the four IAs and a few bilateral agencies. These are designed to assist Article 5 countries to comply with the control targets of the Montreal Protocol. The MP provides the long-term vision for the business plans. <br>As the MLF is a financial mechanism, it is not applicable to consider whether aid reallocation/programming decisions responsive to need can be made at a decentralised level in terms of country or regional offices. Instead, this assessment considers the extent to which IAs delivering activities under the Protocol are able to make responsive reallocation/programming decisions. The document review and interviews with MLF staff and IAs suggested that there is flexibility to make minor changes to implementation plans as required. The requirement for the MLF to review every request for a new tranche of funding creates a “self-cleaning mechanism” which allows for close monitoring of fund allocations and for well-informed adjustments to be made. It is noted, however, that the MLF reporting documents reviewed for this assessment provided limited commentary and analysis of this process.<br>Due to its co-located nature, the MLF uses the human resources (HR) systems and policies of UNEP. As such, this assessment replicates the findings of the 2015-16 MOPAN assessment of UNEP. That assessment found UNEP’s HR function to be satisfactory but noted potential areas for improvement in the consistent and rigorous application of HR systems. The latest available MOPAN assessments for UNDP, UNIDO and the World Bank also reported satisfactory performance.',

    'value': 'With only two presences outside Geneva and few project staff posted in the field, the overall operating model is Geneva-based and driven. UN member states are the driving force behind UNCTAD’s priorities and pillar work streams. Member states also determine the size of the regular budget and are the main sponsors of XB-funded TC interventions.<br>In recent years, UNCTAD faced structural funding gaps and declining resources. Recent budget constraints at the UN Secretariat have compounded matters further. As a result, since 2013, UNCTAD lost 20 RB established posts, and five more posts are proposed to be abolished, bringing the number of regular posts from 400 in 2013 to 375 in 2020. In addition, there are 108 XB-funded staff in temporary posts. These XB-funded staff work exclusively on TC. Eighty per cent are under contract for the ASYCUDA and DMFAS programmes, both of which have dedicated project management units. In many other cases, projects are delivered by UNCTAD staff, alongside other duties.<br>Over the years, UNCTAD’s organisational structures have largely remained untouched. Staff mobility is low, both within the secretariat and outside. There are no records of any recent internal restructuring of the organisation. At the divisional level, staff positions are static. The lack of resources and recent budget cuts hamper UNCTAD’s ability to respond to change.<br>UNCTAD does not have a fundraising strategy that is closely and explicitly aligned to the priorities of the Nairobi Maafikiano and subsequent programme and budget proposals. As in the case of TC planning and programming, fundraising is de facto decentralised and insufficiently co-ordinated. Excluding ASYCUDA and DMFAS, two programmes which have been at the heart of UNCTAD’s TC for the past three decades, the lack of a relevant, up-to-date and strategically aligned fundraising strategy has given rise to a partially fragmented TC portfolio and to a large number of ad hoc, small and short-term projects, rather than longer-term programmes. Despite its potential in the particular context of trade and development, private sector funding is not being pursued by the secretariat and is therefore negligible. UNCTAD’s vulnerability is well-recognised, but secretariat-wide action has thus far been ad hoc. <br>Although some positive steps have been taken in recent years, TCS is insufficiently able to leverage its role on overall co-ordination of projects and programmes, due in part to staff shortages. The decentralised operating model has encouraged the delegation of decision-making authority for TC projects to directors, branch heads and project managers. The secretariat has introduced standardised, automated project approval systems that have contributed to greater transparency and accountability. Still, secretariat-wide strategic level oversight mechanisms are either lacking or under-performing.<br>As part of the UN Secretariat, all aspects of UNCTAD’s human resource management, including performance assessments, are governed by UN Secretariat regulations and rules. All UNCTAD staff members are subject to performance evaluations. The system is in place, and performance is monitored closely on a monthly basis by the Resources Management Service (RMS) through the recently introduced management information system or “dashboard”. There is a backlog in E-performance assessments, despite RMS issuing timely reminders. As for consultants, performance appraisals are carried out at the end of the assignment, for internal use only. These assessments are not shared with the consultant. E-performance is one input for staff promotion decisions. UNCTAD follows the UN Secretariat rules, regulations and guidance, on staff disagreements and complaints regarding performance assessments, as well as other grievance instances; this is done on a case-by-case basis. Because UNCTAD has very limited financial resources for staff training opportunities, it relies on other, informal ways to improve TC-relevant skills among staff, e.g. on results-based management and on designing and implementing UN Development Account projects.',

    'value': 'Organisational restructuring in 2018 saw changes in the organisational structure including the abolishment of some divisions/functions, the creation of new ones and merging of others. As budget constraints prevented external recruitment and in fact there was an overall reduction in posts, this led to the repositioning of existing staff into new roles for which they have limited relevant experience and skills. The organisation is highly centralised, and capacity at the field level is very slim, both in terms of number of personnel and the skills they offer, and in terms of financial resources. There are almost twice as many Individual Service Agreement (ISA) (short-term personnel), largely employed by projects, as fixed-term staff, leading to loss of continuity and inefficiencies in transaction costs.<br>UNIDO undertakes resource mobilisation with no resource mobilisation strategy or targets. The majority of UNIDO’s funding is project specific and earmarked. UNIDO’s regular budget is shrinking, but its voluntary contributions have increased. The organisation’s strategy is to leverage additional funding from financial entities, to seek to persuade donors not to earmark funding and to continue rolling out the PCP modality. While countries are expected to commit resources, this does not always happen. The PCPs have introduced a higher level of expectation of domestic funding commitment for PCP countries, although this has not yet translated into significant funding.<br>There are organisational guidelines which describe the delegation of decision-making, but these are not adequate for clear accountability. Field staff note that processes for financial decision-making are not adequately delegated to the field and that procedures to access funds are slow and cumbersome. In practice UNIDO Representatives only have access to field office budgets and limited other funds; project funds are managed by HQ project managers (allotment holders). <br>Human Resource (HR) systems and policies include a Staff Performance Management System for logging and monitoring staff performance against objectives. Although its intended use is for all personnel in a systematic fashion, this does not always hold true. It does not clearly link back to the MTPF and overarching management priorities. There are concerns regarding HR issues for maternity leave, part-time working and flexible working time, particularly for women, which have a negative impact on staff wellbeing.',

    'value': 'UNODC has systems in place and seeks to align and adjust its organisational structures and staffing so that it can deliver. However, its de facto operating model and the scarcity of core resources mean that its ability to direct resources to either programmatic or corporate strategic priorities is highly circumscribed. The assessment team also heard concerns from staff that the Division for Management absorbed too high a proportion of core resources and staff and that there was inadequate transparency on the allocation and use of programme support costs by the Division for Management. <br>The way in which UNODC mobilises resources is partially consistent with its core mandate and strategic priorities. In practice, resource mobilisation in UNODC is highly decentralised, and responsibility is devolved to units that manage funded programmes. Predictable and flexible funding remains a challenge for UNODC to support the 2030 Agenda and address the growing demands of member states. Individual programme managers and staff in headquarters branches and field offices are de facto responsible for raising funds specifically for programmes under them (i.e. they secure earmarked funding). In almost all its official documents, UNODC and its external auditors note that the volume of funds is increasing but that flexibility is not. In mid-2018, UNODC produced a resource mobilisation and partnerships strategy, but this has not yet succeeded in making UNODC less driven by donors’ priorities. It also does not address or seek to resolve a degree of internal competition for resources that, stakeholders concur, undermines UNODC’s effectiveness. <br>Decentralised units and headquarters units can design and seek donor funding for programmes with a high degree of freedom. The ability of units to manage these interventions effectively influences how responsive UNODC can be; this is determined to a high degree by the way authority is delegated in UNODC. UNODC has inherited a new delegated authority framework from the UN Secretariat. The ambition underpinning the policy is to streamline delivery. This policy had not yet been implemented at the time of the assessment, and it was not clear what impact it would have. Several UNODC interviewees stressed that existing procedures were overly centralised and sometimes hindered their ability to deliver. They expressed a concern that the Division for Management takes a conservative approach to apply UN Secretariat rules and procedures. <br>As part of the UN Secretariat, UNODC is obliged to implement all the Secretariat’s human resource management policies and systems. These have been designed to support the achievement of results and are detailed and comprehensive in all the aspects one would expect. UNODC has a programme to strengthen its implementation of these policies. Interviews indicate a common perception that, in practice, staff performance that is rewarded – by promotion or postings – is individuals’ ability to attract donor funds.',

    'value': 'Staffing is being realigned following organisational restructuring in 2018 which saw the abolition of some divisions/functions, the creation of new ones and merging of others. The MTPF 2018-21 prioritises closer collaboration between HQ and field offices, as a means to contribute to the integration and scaling up of results. It is noted though that in some cases realignment and moving of personnel and avoiding external recruitment have not always been effective and efficient, for example existing personnel being placed in new roles or functions for which they have limited relevant experience and skills. In general, however, the skills and experience of staff are highly rated, and this is confirmed by the partner survey.<br>The 2017 annual report notes how field restructuring has resulted “in the staffing of all five regional hubs, all four regional offices and 35 out of 38 country offices”. Staff at HQ described the current field structure as being “very slim” though, with field offices generally consisting of just two people (a UNIDO Representative [UR]/UNIDO Country Representative [UCR] and an assistant/driver) supplemented by consultants. The partner survey found relatively negative responses to the question “UNIDO has sufficient staffing to deliver the results it intends in Country X” confirming this finding and lower levels of satisfaction overall with this indicator. Some noted that the Programme and Budget Committee have been querying whether field offices would still be needed in the context of UN reform. Some field staff described trying to be innovative, for example using project staff creatively to supplement the lack of human capacity in field offices. Regarding staffing, the 2018-19 Programme and Budget states that the total number of posts has been decreased by 9.5%. There are almost twice as many ISA (short-term staff), largely employed by projects, as fixed-term staff. Staff also emphasised that a large proportion of personnel are on short-term contracts or consultants and suggested that having more regular staff would promote accountability and commitment to the organisation.<br>Regarding resource allocations, the 2018-19 budget introduces some new elements into the structure to better capture the changing environment around UNIDO. While Major Programmes A, E and F remain relatively unchanged, (Policy-making Organs, Buildings Management and Indirect Costs respectively), Major Programmes B, C and D (Executive direction and Strategic Management, Thematic Programme Framework: Towards ISID, and Corporate Management and Operations) include significant innovations to reflect some changes in the organisational structure, which are closely tied to the programmatic framework. Resource allocation is thus aligned to the MTPF and four strategic priorities, which is clearly reflected in the sub-components of Major Programme C; Programmes C.1-C.4 cover services under the thematic fields of “creating shared prosperity”, “advancing economic competitiveness”, “safeguarding the environment” and “cross cutting services” related to “strengthening knowledge and institutions”. Staff described UNIDO has being in “a constant cash crisis” and thus rationalised the need to maintain a high vacancy rate. Not all staff are being replaced when leaving. Long-serving UNIDO staff described how the structure of the organisation has completely changed in the last 20 years, with significantly fewer professional staff in post and more consultants. <br>UNIDO’s staff profile is marked by lack of gender parity. Despite efforts to change this over several years, including through developing a Gender Parity Action Plan, UNIDO will have to make considerable effort to reach the 50/50 goal “well before 2030”, as set out by the UN Secretary-General in the UN System-wide Strategy on Gender Parity. The challenge is greatest for senior posts. While the staff gender ratio at professional levels in 2018 was 58% male: 42% female; at grades D1 and above, only 4 staff were female compared to 17 male staff, which corresponds to a 19% level, one of the lowest in the UN System. There has been greater improvement in the gender balance among ISA holders. Low levels of external recruitment hinder rapid change in gender <br>profile; women are now being deliberately targeted in any recruitment campaigns that take place and training is provided to women staff to encourage internal promotions, but with limited impact on the staff gender profile to date. Other factors that may affect gender balance in UNIDO are that the way in which UNIDO’s terms and conditions are applied is not very childcare friendly; part-time working and flexible working to accommodate childcare are not available. These limitations may reflect the lack of women in senior posts to influence organisational thinking. <br>The rationale for the 2018 internal restructuring is stated in documentation as being necessary to achieve the organisation’s goals and objectives and downsizing due to the decreasing regular budget. The whole field network has moved into the Programme Development and Technical Cooperation (PTC) Division with the expectation that Field Offices should be more involved in Programme Development and Technical Cooperation; interviewees noted that field offices can be excellent entry points for funding and for implementation. It is too early to say whether this shift has had positive effects. Limited staffing capacity is a general challenge observed across the whole field network. Instances were cited where individuals’ skills are not fit for purpose or appropriate to meet changing strategic aims and external requirements, for example of UN Reform.',

    'value': 'UNODC seeks to align and adjust its organisational structures and staffing so that it can deliver, but it is limited in the extent to which it can do this by its lack of core funding. Staffing in UNODC is aligned to deliver the donor-funded and financed results of the strategic plan. Because UNODC has such limited core/unearmarked funds, it has little scope to deploy staff unless the activity is funded by extrabudgetary sources. It is limited in its ability to, independent of donor programme funding, deploy resources to functions that ordinarily would be financed by core funds. Evaluation, results-based management and gender mainstreaming are all examples of functions that have had to be “projectised” and that are dependent to some extent on continued donor funding. UNODC’s financial statement on 2018 reports that 86% of UNODC’s total expenditure (USD 333 million) derived from earmarked special purpose funds, 6% derived from programme support costs funds, charged against special purpose contributions, and only 1% of expenditure derived from unearmarked/general purpose funds (USD 4.7 million). A further 7% (2.4 million) of expenditure derived from the regular budget contribution.<br>In its 2020 budget, UNODC anticipates that of its 634 core staff only 124 posts (20%) will be funded by the regular budget: 510 will be funded by extrabudgetary resources. All its other staff are on donor-funded contracts. Several interviewees, echoing the Secretary-General’s call to focus on taking the UN closer to its ultimate beneficiaries, considered that UNODC should rebalance its staffing profile so that a smaller proportion of staff are based in headquarters and more are closer to the point of delivery in the field. Some individual branches have rebalanced the ratio of their staff between headquarters and field locations. But there does not appear to have been a systemic review or a policy to pursue this change. <br>There is evidence that UNODC does seek to align resource allocations across functions with its current organisational priorities and goals. But again, due to the scarcity of core funds, it is highly limited in its scope to do this. Flexible core funds (regular budget and programme support cost) are scarce and in high demand. Some interviewees considered that the allocation of these scarce core funds is not strategic in practice: they claimed that they are spread so thinly as to have little strategic impact. The assessment team also heard repeated concerns from staff that the Division for Management absorbed too high a proportion of core resources and that there was inadequate transparency on the allocation and use of programme support cost by the Division for Management. It is difficult to assess whether this is a perception or reality. <br>UNODC has had to reverse at least one recent allocation decision that does not appear to have been in the strategic interests of UNODC. Providing independent research is one of UNODC’s core functions. However, in its original 2018-19 budget, the Office proposed to make the Research and Trend Analysis Branch entirely dependent on extrabudgetary programme funding. This would have reduced the independence of the branch and its products. FINGOV rejected the proposal, and the branch is now dependent on a combination of regular and programme funding.<br>UNODC’s internal restructuring exercises appear to have a clear purpose and intent and have tended to be aligned to the priorities of the current strategic plan. As an Office of the Secretariat, UNODC is also affected by changes driven by the UN Secretariat. The Secretariat is driving organisational reforms, and the introduction of core operational systems such as Umoja, and its future iterations, have had a strategic as well as an operational impact on all entities of the organisation; in addition, UNODC’s Division for Management will be impacted by the introduction of new Global Service Delivery Centres the UN Secretariat is introducing. This in turn will drive restructuring in headquarters. <br>UNODC has the latitude to introduce organisational changes and has the requisite processes. Restructuring proposals are submitted to the Director of the Division and/or the Executive Director and are required to include the purpose of the reorganisation and staffing implications. In 2018, the Division of Operations started an internal review process to see how it could better align operations in relation to the UN development system reform. UNODC’s anti-money laundering and cyber-crime sections were combined to form a new section (the Cybercrime and Anti-Money Laundering Section) in January 2018 to strengthen the synergy between these interrelated agendas. <br>The relationship between UNODC’s policy and delivery units and the unit responsible for supporting delivery, the Division for Management, introduces a degree of complexity to UNODC’s ability to deliver. UNODC’s Division for Management, while functionally part of UNODC, is also part of UNOV. Through the Division for Management, UNOV provides UNODC with various services (e.g. financial resources management, procurement, human resource management, information technology and communication). The Director-General of UNOV by appointment of the UN Secretary-General is also the Executive Director of UNODC. UNODC and UNOV have equal status as Offices outside the main UN Secretariat headquarters. However, while UNOV is a service provider to UNODC, UNODC does not have a choice in what entity supplies services, and the head of UNODC has an institutional incentive to maintain UNOV’s relationship with UNODC. <br>The provision of management services by an independent office of the UN, UNOV, means that there is potential for competing incentives. The incentives of the Division for Management/UNOV to be responsive to the UN Secretariat’s directives will, at the very least, be equal to demands placed by UNODC for it to be responsive. Several interviewees felt that the Division for Management interprets UN Secretariat rules conservatively in several areas – and that this impedes UNODC’s effectiveness. The arrangement also leads to some anomalies. For example, due to UNOV’s status as part of a programme of the United Nations, and the mandate given to UNODC’s evaluation unit by the commissions, the evaluation unit does not have the ability to assess the management impact of the Division for Management, because In-depth Evaluations of the effectiveness of programmes of the UN are mandated by the General Assembly via the Committee for Programme and Coordination and carried out by the UN Secretariat’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). This is an unusual restriction on the scope of an evaluation function to assess internal effectiveness (see MI 8.1).',

    'value': 'When the current CRPs were first started, there was initial support from the Funders, which helped to initially meet some of the optimistic financial planning by Research Centers. In 2015, however, Funders support to Windows 1 and 2 declined substantially and, as a result, the Research Centers have had to engage in resource mobilisation to ensure the continuation of the CRPs. The new business plan and the associated FINPLAN set out a new approach to resource mobilisation. The objective of the 2019-2021 FINPLAN is to agree to a realistic, transparent and achievable plan shared by Funders and Research Centers ensuring the CGIAR research priorities identified are sufficiently resourced during the 2019-21 period. <br>CGIAR has a range of donors and has considerable experience of working with the private sector. The approach to deepening private sector collaboration is a pragmatic one: “building a System-wide partnership with selected multinational companies to collaborate on advanced research, development impact, and global advocacy.”<br>While efforts have already been made to ensure multi-year funding, more are being made. They include an ambition in the 2019-2021 FINPLAN for “System Funders providing greater clarity in the form of multi-year funding pledges or, at minimum, notional Statements of Funder Intention to improve the predictability of total available funding for CGIAR research as well as programmatic level projections.”<br>As with partnerships with the private sector, the emphasis in the FINPLAN is on partnerships with partner countries/institutions, rather than raising domestic resources: therefore better collaboration at country level is a key objective for CGIAR. It is stated in the FINPLAN that: through enhanced collaboration with national partners, strategic partnerships with other organisations working in those countries and relevant co-ordination among CGIAR entities operating in the same countries, increased impact can be realised.<br>Finally, the FINPLAN includes a commitment that “underpinning this plan is a concerted effort to increase the volume, predictability and stability of available funding which is required to help address the sustainable financial viability of CGIAR Research Centers that the Audit and Risk Committee of the System Management Board is closely monitoring.” All of this comes with clear targets and a commitment to greater transparency around funding.',

    'value': 'The document review suggests that the resource mobilisation strategy is explicitly aligned to the strategic plan and core mandate. The 2018 MLF Executive Committee Primer reports that “the Multilateral Fund provides financing for the incremental costs of the phase-out of substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol”. The Executive Committee Primer (2018) describes how “proposals for investment projects and activities are submitted to the Executive Committee with a recommendation based on a review of the project by the Secretariat”. The MLF Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria (2017) document, particularly the chapter on Project Proposals, provides detailed guidance on how funding is allocated. The MLF Multilateral Fund: Governance, Business Model, Accomplishments (2019) management document offers a useful overview concerning replenishment periods of the MLF. A 2015 evaluation by the World Bank, Resource Mobilisation for HCFC Phase-out and Climate Mitigation Co-Benefits, reported some of the challenges of securing long-term funding for obligations under the Montreal Protocol. <br>Diversification of the funding base is considered non-applicable to this review. The 2012 ICF Evaluation of the Financial Mechanism of the Montreal Protocol suggested a possible means of diversifying the funding base of the Montreal Protocol; however, it is too old to fall within the range of documents considered for this review. The evaluation reported that “co-funding may be available through the voluntary carbon market to support the recovery and destruction of ODS [ozone depleting substances] in Article 5 countries. The Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) has recently approved a new methodology for these ODS destruction project activities. The Executive Committee should consider encouraging National Ozone Units (NOUs) and agencies to look at and pursue these synergies and linkages, as they serve to further the ozone agenda. It is important to note, however, that the pursuit of these synergies has associated costs and challenges; some “resource mobilisation” activities have already been approved”.<br>Multi-year funding is sought and obtained. The MLF has been replenished every three years since 1994 by the Parties to the MP.<br>Resource mobilisation prioritising the raising of domestic resources from partner countries/institutions was considered non-applicable in the context of this review, given the nature of the Montreal Protocol and MLF receiving a level of resources determined by treaty.<br>The MLF resource mobilisation strategy contains clear targets, monitoring and reporting mechanisms. Resource mobilisation is monitored through annual agency progress reports, annual accounts reconciliation, special reports on delays, reports on specific projects, procedures for cancellation, project competition reports, return of balances from completed projects, return of balances from completed projects and thematic evaluations by independent monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (MLF, 2019, The Multilateral Fund: Governance, Business Model, Accomplishments).',

    'value': 'The current TC strategy of UNCTAD was adopted in 2003. As in the case of TC planning and programming, fundraising is de facto decentralised, with sections and branches trying to mobilise funds from member states and others, in some cases very successfully, in others less so. The two largest TC programmes, ASYCUDA and DMFAS, have successfully mobilised domestic resources as well as donor funding, meaning that for the majority of TC projects, resource mobilisation has proven satisfactory.<br>The secretariat does not have an up-to-date corporate fundraising strategy. Attempts were made in 2013 with a non-paper and a concept note for a funding mechanism for pending TC requests (2016), but a consensus was not achieved by member states for approval by the Trade and Development Board. As a result, UNCTAD does not yet have a fundraising strategy that is closely and explicitly aligned to the priorities of the Nairobi Maafikiano and subsequent programme and budget proposals.<br>In December 2018, over 80 sources of funding contributed to 249 TC interventions. In December 2018, ASYCUDA and DMFAS accounted for about 56% of total expenditures (USD 25.5 million) and were financed mainly by direct contribution from the respective member states and from proceeds of loans or grants from international financial institutions. Compared with 2017, in 2018 TC funding decreased by 3% to USD 34 million. Compared with 2016, extrabudgetary funding decreased by 20% (from USD 40 million in 2018), while total expenditure for TC rose to USD 44 million. The average expenditure per project per year is approximately USD 170 000.<br>Currently, most of the trust fund contributions are tightly earmarked by single contributors for specific projects. Only a few trust funds established in UNCTAD share the features of multi-donor thematic funds, such as co-mingled contributions, greater flexibility in fund allocation and consolidated reports. At present, only a few donors provide predictable annual contributions regulated by a co-operation agreement signed between the donor and UNCTAD. In the context of the structural shortage of donor funding, fundraising, especially for TC projects in the LDCs, is an ongoing theme at meetings of the Working Party. At the 78th session, delegates and representatives of regional groups expressed concerns about the lack of funding support to the multi-donor trust fund for the LDCs in the past few years. UNCTAD continuously invites member states to make more predictable and flexible multi-year contributions, including to the new multi-donor trust fund on trade and productive capacity, to scale up activities under the UNCTAD-led United Nations Inter-Agency Cluster on Trade and Productive Capacity.<br>Excluding ASYCUDA and DMFAS, two programmes which have been at the heart of UNCTAD’s TC for the past three decades and which account for the majority of TC activities, the lack of a relevant, up-to-date and strategically aligned fundraising strategy has given rise to a partially fragmented TC portfolio and to a large number of ad hoc, small and short-term projects, rather than longer-term programmes.<br>While fundraising is acknowledged as a corporate priority and recommended as such by OIOS and external evaluations, particularly for multi-year funds, it has not yet been elevated to the extent needed. For instance, the synthesis of five subprogramme evaluations states that “recommendations on fundraising were fairly convergent in identifying a need for UNCTAD to have a systematic and targeted resources mobilisation strategy or plan to better meet increasing requests for TC. The plan should cover different funding sources, including the private sector, and country-level mechanisms.” Weaknesses identified included the need for: (i) improving communications and dissemination of UNCTAD products, including the UNCTAD website, and enhancing use of new communication tools and products; and (ii) generally increasing the visibility of UNCTAD, especially at the national and regional levels.<br>An internal SharePoint database is in place to make the entering and updating of (official) requests from beneficiary countries easier and more accessible. For certain programmes (e.g. DMFAS), donor advisory groups have been established that meet on a regular basis. Whenever project managers are raising funds, internal guidelines stipulate that TCS should be informed when negotiations or contacts have reached a stage where funding seems a real possibility.<br>Donor mapping and matchmaking is done at various levels in the secretariat, but in an uncoordinated manner. The Secretary-General and DSG engage in fundraising efforts, drawing on information from divisions. Efforts are being made to diversify the funding base and obtain multi-year, unearmarked funding, including the DSG’s visits to donor headquarters, but so far with limited success. Evidence from interviews point to an urgent need for a corporate, secretariat-wide approach to fundraising, involving appropriate staff training and a well-focused communications strategy.<br>UNCTAD’s ability to receive funding from private entities is regulated by United Nations financial regulations and rules, the UN Secretary-General’s bulletin on the acceptance of pro bono goods and services, and the Guidelines on Cooperation between the United Nations and the Business Sector (20 November 2009). UNCTAD may accept voluntary contributions, gifts or donations from a private entity, provided that the independence, impartiality and reputation of UNCTAD are not affected. Thus, in accordance with United Nations financial regulation 3.11, a contribution may be accepted, provided that the purposes of the contribution are consistent with the policies, aims and activities of the United Nations, and that the contribution does not create an additional direct or indirect financial liability for the United Nations.<br>In practice, however, despite its potential in the particular context of trade and development, private sector funding is negligible. Documentary evidence suggests that UNCTAD is not keen on exploring this avenue; according to the proceedings of the 78th Working Party session (2019), the DSG noted that “there might be some associated challenges with regard to mobilising funds from the private sector, such as the mismatch between the interests of the private sector and the nature of UNCTAD TC, which was focused on government policies and legal and regulatory frameworks. UNCTAD could approach the private sector with regard to some TC programmes, but it was not necessary to devise a strategy for mobilising funds from the private sector.”<br>The new UNCTAD request database compiles the formal requests for TC that have been received since 1 January 2013 and cleared by the UNCTAD secretariat. It serves as an information platform for all stakeholders and aims to enhance the transparency on UNCTAD TC and facilitate funds mobilisation. The request database is updated regularly. In 2019, out of a total USD 106 million required for 317 TC requests, only 25% (USD 26.7 million) had been secured.<br>UNCTAD’s vulnerability is well-recognised by the secretariat, but secretariat-wide action to address this has thus far been inconsistent. All in all, despite a satisfactory performance of the two main programmes, ASYCUDA and DMFAS, this leads to an unsatisfactory score for this MI.',

    'value': 'UNIDO does not have a specific and designated resource mobilisation strategy. The Secretariat indicates that efforts to improve internal operations such as resource mobilisation are critical for the successful delivery of the MTPF. Some interviewees felt that a resource mobilisation strategy is not necessary for UNIDO whose funding is project-specific and often earmarked. It was suggested that the only need for such a strategy would be to satisfy external demands to see one. <br>The DG’s Mobilization of financial resources report states that UNIDO should “maintain a continuous dialogue with member states in order to actively sustain the common resource mobilization effort” (26), and in 2017 the Secretariat was requested by the General Conference to “develop a resource mobilization strategy which should, inter alia, define the scale of extra-budgetary resources for technical co-operation activities and identify new sources of funding for the non-technical cooperation activities” (26). UNIDO is described by auditors as having a “shrinking” regular budget but “increasing voluntary contributions”.<br>The report by the DG on Mobilization of financial resources recognises the need to diversify the funding base. Interviewees at HQ explained that UNIDO is advocating for contributions to thematic trust funds and for discouraging earmarked funding. The partnership trust fund is currently well funded but heavily reliant on contributions from one country, China, that contributed USD 2.5 million in 2018; China has announced it will increase voluntary contributions further. The various trust funds provide a relatively small proportion of UNIDO’s expenditure, although they are important in meeting specific requirements; in 2018 they amounted to USD 2.6 million towards technical co-operation activities. To leverage additional flows of resources, UNIDO also partners with financial entities including international financial institutions (IFIs) and development finance institutions (DVIs) such as the African Development Bank, European Investment Bank and World Bank. <br>The 2018 annual report indicates, “An important outcome of UNIDO activities is the leveraging of investments or co-financing” (20). It states that USD 357.2 million of partnership-based co-financing/leveraging was achieved in 2018, following USD 390 million in 2017. The cumulative amount of USD 854.5 million exceeds the USD 827.5 million target that UNIDO had set for itself.<br>Most funds are project-specific and are generally multi-year. The project-based approach based on earmarked funding means that funds do not necessarily contribute to multi-year programmes at country level, nor are they necessarily closely aligned to strategic priorities and results. The PCP model may become a tool for building a more programmatic and strategic approach in future. <br>Building country ownership and encouraging use of domestic resources is part of UNIDO’s standard way of working. While countries are expected to commit resources, this does not always happen. UNIDO’s roll-out of the PCP is premised on seeking multi-partner funding and “the stated objective of the PCP to mobilise external partners and additional resources in order to extend the impact of UNIDO’s technical cooperation…” (45). The PCPs also have a higher level of expectation of domestic funding commitments. Interviews found that a major challenge for UNIDO is raising enough funding at country level for middle-income countries (MICs), as donors are less interested in supporting them. UNIDO may need to consider how to adapt to the changing donor and UN landscape for funding in the case of MICs. Such cases require more advocacy from HQ to assist with raising funds. Sometimes a small amount of money can leverage and open doors to much larger funding, including domestic funding.<br>Field offices also undertake resource mobilisation for country projects, and UNIDO Representatives usually lead on this, liaising with donors and potential donors in the country to identify funding possibilities.<br>There are no stated objectives, targets or priorities for resource mobilisation beyond ensuring that the MTPF commitments are funded.',

    'value': 'The way that UNODC mobilises resources is partially consistent with its core mandate and strategic priorities. In practice, resource mobilisation in UNODC is highly decentralised, and responsibility is devolved to units that manage funded programmes. Predictable and flexible funding remains a challenge for UNODC to support the 2030 Agenda and address the growing demands of member states. Individual programme managers and staff in headquarters branches and field offices are de facto responsible for raising funds specifically for programmes under them. Staff need to seek funding to secure the continuity of existing programmes, fund new programmes, and continue paying the salaries and support costs of their units or field offices. In almost all its official documents, UNODC and its external auditors note that the volume of funds is increasing but that flexibility is not. The proportion of unearmarked funds it receives is declining, with general purpose income at around 1.0% of total income in 2018. The low levels of unearmarked or soft-earmarked funding are a key challenge to the effective implementation of the mandates and programmes of UNODC and put a strain on its management, co-ordination and normative functions. In mid-2018, UNODC produced a resource mobilisation and partnerships strategy, but this has not yet succeeded in making UNODC less driven by donors’ priorities. It also does not address or seek to resolve a degree of internal competition for resources that, stakeholders concur, undermines UNODC’s effectiveness. <br>UNODC developed a “Resource mobilisation and partnerships strategy” in mid-2018 to try to break out of this cycle. The strategy has three pillars: to grow UNODC funding from the public sector; to develop engagement to diversify funding sources and partnerships; and to strengthen enabling factors for more successful partnerships and fundraising. UNODC holds “strategic dialogue” meetings with key member states to seek stronger and more flexible support. UNODC updates its stakeholders and seeks additional support for underfunded areas in FINGOV meetings. <br>UNODC’s 2018 strategy clearly identifies the need to diversify funding sources and partnerships and notes that UNODC could seek to approach private foundations and individual donors. But it also states that doing this within its available capacity would be difficult. UNODC reported in early 2019 that it had indeed enhanced its outreach to the private sector by engaging members of employers’ associations, umbrella organisations of chambers of commerce and industry, <br>professional associations, and other organised structures through their organisations. Its aim is to develop partnerships based on issues of common interests, such as the fight against corruption, money-laundering and the smuggling of counterfeit goods. It reports that it is trialling this approach in France, Germany and Switzerland. <br>UNODC does seek multi-year funding and does manage to get longer-term commitments from some of its donors. It is structuring regional and country programmes in ways that allow donors to provide support to multi-year elements of the programme. It is advocating for multi-year funding agreements and a larger share of non- or soft-earmarked funds. It concluded multi-year funding agreements with Australia and Qatar in 2016 and with German, Norway and the United Kingdom in 2018. However, a significant proportion of donors continue to provide small funding commitments that are often only valid for one year (due to national funding cycles often tied to the national fiscal year) and are also often earmarked for very specific purposes. This funding pattern hampers UNODC’s ability to undertake sustainable planning and achieve long-term objectives: the financing of a significant share of activities and staff costs are only secured on an ad hoc and short-term basis. In addition, hard-earmarked funds often come along with additional donor-specific reporting requirements – making the management of hard-earmarked funds more resource-intensive.<br>Individual programmes have also been taking a more strategic approach to try to secure continuity of funding. An evaluation of the Global Maritime Crime Programme noted it built on lessons learned from an earlier programme and improved its sustainability planning with fundraising taking place 18 months in advance. <br>UNODC’s resource mobilisation strategy recognises the need to raise domestic resources to support the implementation of its mandate. The best example of this is its co-operation agreement with the government of Colombia where UNODC implements a programme with a value of USD 60 million, 90% of which is provided by the Government of Colombia itself. UNODC also supports the restoration of domestic resources through its work that combats illicit financial flows. Some of UNODC’s interventions promote efforts to reduce illicit flows and then support the return of illicit assets, so that they benefit national development. <br>Each of the UNODC’s “Resource mobilisation and partnerships strategy” pillars cite concrete actions to be taken in 2018 to 2021. These actions all appear appropriate and likely to have an impact. It is not clear how the implementation of the strategy will be monitored and what reporting mechanisms have been agreed. <br>UNODC’s resource mobilisation strategy is trying to achieve a balance whereby UNODC is not donor-driven but is able to drive its own strategy and implement its mandates. UNODC has not yet achieved this balance and, to a large extent, units head, individual programme managers and field offices are still de facto responsible for securing earmarked funding for “their” programmes – and so, in effect, UNODC’s activities are still donor-driven. The incentive to pursue extrabudgetary programme support has also been allowed to lead to internal competition for resources and undermines internal collaboration. UNODC’s resource mobilisation strategy does not address any measures to reduce competition for resources between HQ entities and between headquarters and field offices. This tendency has been noted in several reports and was reflected in assessment interviews and the stakeholder survey. <br>An in-depth mid-term cluster evaluation of the Global Programme against Trafficking in Persons and the Global Programme against Smuggling of Migrants noted that the “lack of RB [regular budget] across UNODC at large, puts of a lot a pressure on the programme teams to raise funding, which causes internal competition and by consequence a lack of integrated and cooperative<br><br>programming across sections, field offices as well as within the same units”. A 2017 evaluation of UNODC’s global programme against money-laundering notes that competition for funds between internal and external actors “is a key obstacle and challenge for the programme”. The evaluation stated: “A key obstacle in this area is fundraising and occasional competition for funds between different UNODC divisions as well as different organisations providing AML/CFT [anti-money laundering / countering the financing of terrorism] capacity building.”<br>Three written stakeholder survey comments also made this point. One reflected that “unhealthy competition for funding between different divisions and sections, [and] lack of general purpose funding can undermine independence of core functions and possibly affect (in an impartial way) the focus and priorities of the operations”. Five out of eight members states consulted also claimed that that internal competition – between divisions and between HQ units and between HQ units and the field – undermined UNODC’s effectiveness and needs to be addressed. A significant number of staff representatives noted that this is also a problem. <br>Some donors, particularly those underscoring UNODC’s mandates related to security and law enforcement, tend to insist on earmarking money to specific interventions (and on occasion down to the level of a workshop) they wish to see implemented. However, some donors who approach UNODC from a development perspective do give money in more flexible ways.',

    'value': 'All GEF projects assess country capacity, since sustainability is a key GEF indicator/success marker, and the intervention needs to be designed to ensure it can scale up and maintain capacity gains. Country programmes and project documents identify capacity building interventions, which by inference identify capacity needs. Since UNIDO has piloted increased use of UNIDO Project Executing Entities in 2018, there is a process for assessing the capacity of partners to act as Project Executing Entities, using a HACT (Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers) assessment. <br>For non-GEF projects, there is no consistent approach to analysing capacity needs. Interviewees noted the need for PCPs in particular to undertake a more detailed and systematic analysis of country capacities for industrialisation than is done at present and the need for UNIDO Representatives to strengthen their capacity analysis skills. New tools are planned to enable UNIDO Representatives to undertake an assessment of country capacity.<br>Programme and project documents are usually developed in consultation with national, UN and donor partners and jointly signed off with national counterparts/partners. The extent to which these include capacity assessments which have been jointly developed is not evident.<br>In practice, much of UNIDO’s work is directed to building capacity in different ways through policy support, technology transfer or system strengthening and is a response to government priorities. In Nigeria, UNIDO is supporting capacity development for ISID through developing the capacity of a critical mass of officers in government and parastatals to champion industrialisation. The Bangladesh UNIDO Country Programme identifies data analysis and capacity as a challenge for achieving the SGDs as well as developing the technical and financial capacity of the domestic infrastructure financing market, both of which are identified by the Government of Bangladesh as priorities. <br>For countries with country programmes or PCPs, there is evidence of regular (six-monthly) reflection points by national steering groups/committees which include partners. It is not specified if this includes reflection on capacity requirements and changes. While capacity assessment is the responsibility of the project manager, in practice there should be engagement with the UR/UCR and programme manager for PCP and country programme (CP) countries. Some UR/UCRs do not have the skill sets required for capacity assessment. New tools are planned to enable URs/UCRs to do this.',

    'value': 'To a certain degree, capacity analysis informs intervention design and implementation, and strategies to address any weakness found are employed. National programmes appear to undertake detailed capacity analysis for target recipients; regional and HQ-designed and directed programmes appear to do so to a lesser extent. UNODC uses e-learning and issues specialist toolkits to assist its face-to-face capacity-building support. An evaluation of UNODC’s capacity building found evidence of both positive practice and weaknesses.<br>Some intervention designs contain a clear statement of capacities of key national implementing partners, while others lack this. UNODC’s Programme and Operational Manual is clear on the need for interventions to understand existing capacity in the design stage and what enhancing it would require.<br>There were few detailed analyses of pre-intervention capacities of key national implementation partners in the design documents reviewed. A 2017 evaluation of UNODC’s implementation of capacity building cites several examples of programmes that have used best practice to assess existing capacity, including UNODC’s Global Programme against Money-Laundering, which enabled trainers to follow up training with bespoke support. <br>UNODC produces a broad range of products (e.g. guidelines) that are themselves tools to help practitioners perform specialised capacity analysis and develop capacity. These establish global standards in their specialist areas. The Criminal Justice Assessment Toolkit is one example. UNODC’s innovative Global eLearning programme is a capacity-building tool the Office deploys to increase capacity among a much broader population than would otherwise be possible. The platform holds over 30 thematic courses and gives access to more than 1 000 manuals and guidelines. As of 2018, it had more than 42 000 registered users. <br>Capacity analysis to which the assessment team had access tends not to consider resources, strategy, culture, staff, systems and processes, structure, and performance. There was no evidence of capacity analysis statements being jointly developed. <br>Few capacity analysis statements include clear strategies for addressing weaknesses, with a view to sustainability. Evaluations have advised UNODC programmes to emphasise this. An evaluation of the Regional Programme for West Africa noted that the previous regional programme was hindered by a lack of both research and analysis of capability. The mid-term evaluation of the<br>Global Programme on Strengthening the Legal Regime against Terrorism (GLOR35) noted that “the approach to ensuring sustainability of TPB [Terrorism Prevention Branch] activity is patchy and non-systemic” and that there is a paramount “need to understand the local environment and engage appropriate national institutions to help achieve sustainability”.<br>There is some evidence of regular and resourced reflection points with partners that take note of any significant changes in the wider institutional setting that affects capacity. UNODC provided evidence of a complex tripartite project to provide canine drug-detection support to Afghanistan. The programme was adapted continually to respond to changing circumstances.',

    'value': 'Risk management is an emergent practice for TC at UNCTAD. At the UN Secretariat level, UNCTAD is actively participating in the ongoing discussions led by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance (DMSPC) for the development of a UN-Secretariat-wide Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) policy framework, methodology and tools which will see implementation in the course of 2020. Recently, UNCTAD has developed Due Diligence Guidelines for Partnerships to ensure a more coherent and streamlined approach on due diligence standards and procedure.<br>At the level of TC interventions, the project document template now also includes a requirement for the assessment of risk. However, these are not broken down into the four risk categories (operational, strategic, political, reputational). The project clearance checklist also includes risk analysis and potential mitigation actions to be put in place for all project planning. Interviews indicate that ensuring that staff comply with UN rules and regulations is a work in progress; until recently, no such system existed. Project Officers and now being taught to carry out the due diligence process prior to signing an agreement.<br> Survey respondents appreciate UNCTAD’s risk management, with 90% giving positive ratings. This is in contrast with the analysis from the project sample from the same countries, where only limited evidence was found of a risk framework, identification or consideration of risk in the project descriptions, nor in the limited number of logframes or monitoring and evaluation plans available for review. Some project documents included a list of potential risks, without adding mitigation or monitoring requirements. The Angola Train for Trade II project includes a risk table of operational, strategic and political risks, mitigation actions, and risk tracking. The DMFAS project in Bangladesh describes risks and assumptions, which are included in the project logframe. Where there is no, or only limited risk management/monitoring described in the design, issues and solutions are reported as they arise in progress reporting for most projects.',

    'value': 'Systematic and consistent risk analysis and mitigation procedures have only relatively recently been introduced to UNIDO. Enterprise risk management (ERM) was introduced in 2013, largely based on the existing management processes. ERM is still in development. A Risk Management Committee and workplan to develop risk have been established (2017), and the Audit Advisory Committee, which includes an expert in corporate risk management, has provided advice. The UNIDO Risk Focal Point, the Director of the Department of External Relations, has completed an initial institution-wide risk mapping exercise to identify the main perceived risks in key areas of UNIDO’s operations.<br>There is no standard approach to risk analysis, mitigation or reporting. Levels of appetite for risk and risk mitigation approaches are not defined and are still work in progress for 2019-20. The links between enterprise and project are not yet made. The Report of the External Auditor for 2017 found that “risk management as a systematic and holistic approach is still at the early stages of development. Risk assessment and mitigation are neither consistently applied across the organisation nor systematically documented” (25). <br>There is an expectation that risks will be identified at concept note stage and during implementation, but risks are not clearly documented in intervention designs. There is no systematic or consistent approach to assessing risk and quantifying it. The 2006 guidelines for the Technical Cooperation Programme and Project Cycle require project managers to “[l]ist any external factors that may affect the delivery of the UNIDO assistance and indicate what actions have been or will be taken to reduce them” (45). Different types of risk (e.g. operational, reputational, political) are not specified in the guidelines, and a review of country programmes showed a range of different approaches taken to risk assessment and specification. Where country programmes entail risk assessment and mitigation measures for economic, partnership, political, security and competitor risks (in Nigeria) and for governance, international environment impact and sustainability (in Ethiopia) these are at a very high and generalised level, with no clear responsibility for implementation. There was an absence of detailed mitigating strategies, and no evidence was seen of these risks being actively reviewed. <br>The ESSPP provide a risk assessment for environmental and social issues, which may also indirectly affect reputational, operational and political risk. The ESSPP categorise projects into Category A, where they are likely to have significant adverse environmental or social impacts, in which case an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) is undertaken, leading to an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP); Category B which is likely to have fewer adverse effects, and has no ESIA but does have an Environmental and Social Management Plan; or Category C which has minimal or no adverse impacts, and requires neither. For projects undertaken in partnership with other organisations, there is a due diligence process for assessing potential partners which would in practice address reputational, operational and political risks. The ESSPP apply to all projects from 2019.<br>Country programme progress reports submitted to the national partnership steering committees note challenges and mitigating actions where these are taken. Risk mitigation actions are not systematically documented. Interviewees reported that in practice major risks would be taken to steering committees and smaller risks managed on a day-to-day basis by the project manager. There is no specific risk assessment protocol for PCPs.<br>Interviewees noted that moving to a more rigorous risk-based approach, for instance using the ESSPP, is a culture shift for UNIDO and that training to support the change is being undertaken.',

    'value': 'UNODC is strengthening its treatment of risk at all levels. It follows the UN Secretariat’s guidance on Enterprise Risk Management and has implemented its policies since 2014. All its regional offices have developed comprehensive risk registers, as have global programmes and all programme interventions. Field offices and country programmes are beginning to develop risk registers. UNODC risk registers address strategic, political, operational risk and reputational risks.<br>UNODC developed an enterprise-level risk register in 2014 based on the UN Secretariat’s model: it addresses strategic, governance, operational and financial risks. Risk areas and the treatment/response are monitored, updated and reported to senior management every six months. The Executive Director’s office is the institutional focal point, and all divisions have focal points who are supposed to meet regularly. UNODC liaises with the newly established Enterprise Risk Management Unit within the UN Secretariat’s Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance to keep step with Secretariat guidance and lessons in risk management. Within the framework of the corporate Enterprise Risk Management Unit, UNODC has developed risk registers and response plans for field offices. Each programme document contains a risk assessment table which is monitored through a tripartite review mechanism (beneficiaries, funding partners and UNODC) that is generally established in each programme. Evidence was found that intervention designs include detailed analysis of, and mitigation strategies for, operational risk – both in headquarters and for country or regional programmes. The Division of Treaty Affairs’ January 2019 Risk Register update was reviewed and was an impressively comprehensive and pragmatic treatment of risk. <br>Intervention designs do include detailed analysis of and mitigation strategies for strategic risk. The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Risk Register addresses strategic risks explicitly. Strategic risks are also considered in country and regional programmes. For example, the Regional Programmes for West Africa and for Eastern Africa identify the probability, impact under external risks and a risk mitigation strategy for each operational section in external risks. <br>Intervention designs do include detailed analysis of and mitigation strategies for political risk, as well as for reputational risk at all the different levels. The ERM document presents a table that includes the reputational impact of different risks. It gives scoring criteria for the measurement of impact, likelihood and level of control effectiveness. <br>Risks are routinely monitored and reflected upon by delivery partnerships. UNODC is developing a fraud and corruption risk register, which includes the risk of ineffective control and monitoring of external party transactions. This will cover risks areas including procurement, implementing partners as well as related party transactions.<br>Risk mitigation actions taken in partnerships are documented and communicated. As indicated, each programme document contains a risk assessment table. UNODC requires risk to be monitored through a tripartite review mechanism involving beneficiaries, funding partners and UNODC.',

    'value': 'As described under MI 5.2 and KPI 2, the project appraisal process now requires the analysis of gender equality and women’s empowerment considerations, and guidelines and checklists are in place. This marks a significant improvement for the secretariat, compared with the situation in the first half of this decade.<br>UNCTAD’s Checklist for Mainstreaming Gender Equality in TC projects enables project officers and managers to assess gender mainstreaming potential and examine points of gender mainstreaming at various stages of the project cycle: project analysis (including gender assessment/differential impacts on women and men and use of gender disaggregated data), definition of the logframe (including gender issues and gender sensitive indicators and baseline), budget, stakeholder’s participation, risk analysis, Project monitoring and evaluation (including self-monitoring, progress and final reports, and external evaluation).<br>With the exception of economic governance, which is integral to most TC interventions, there is little evidence to suggest that other cross-cutting issues (environmental sustainability and climate change, and respect for human rights) are consistently included in the design of TC interventions.<br>Plans for monitoring and evaluation increasingly pay attention to gender and economic governance, but insufficiently to environmental and human rights considerations.<br>Survey responses show that stakeholders have limited familiarity with UNCTAD’s cross-cutting strategies, with the exception of economic governance, and also limited visibility on how these may or may not affect performance. On reviewing the sample of documents of projects being implemented in the surveyed countries, we see that gender is rarely mentioned in project documents. In the more recent Angola Train for Trade II project, there is evidence of gender targets and gender disaggregated data points in the project logframe. Environmental sustainability was found in the case of the Zambia UNSDCF project, and as an output in the Rwanda UNSDCF project and the Angola Train for Trade II project.',

    'value': 'Intervention guidance does not clearly state how to analyse cross-cutting issues, although projects are required to consider environmental and gender considerations. No mention is made of human rights or governance. The Technical Cooperation Guidelines (published in 2006) which remain the current guidelines, require that all activities across the project/programme cycle “should be guided by environmental and gender considerations” and that gender “should be addressed as specifically as possible” (45). Subsequently, the Programme and Project Formulation and Approval Function process was introduced in 2016, which adds a requirement for projects to be cleared and approved by UNIDO leads for environmental issues, as well as gender mainstreaming. <br>There is no specific guidance on how cross-cutting issues should be analysed in project designs, although there is gender equality screening at project formulation (concept) stage. The Technical Cooperation Guidelines provide no guidance related to gender, other than to be specific about gender “in relation to target beneficiaries, if possible” and “to use gender disaggregated data, if appropriate” (45). No guidance is provided on environmental issues. Governance and human rights are not mentioned in the Technical Cooperation Guidelines. The ESSPP, introduced in 2019, set out standards for compliance in relation to social and environmental issues and to human rights which must be met to gain approval; however, the relatively recent introduction of ESSPP means that few projects to date have been developed to meet ESSPP requirements. The relationship between the ESSPP and Technical Cooperation Guidelines is not made clear.<br>In lieu of clear generic gender equality guidance, all UNIDO technical co-operation projects undergo a mandatory gender mainstreaming review, requiring projects to be screened and approved by the UNIDO Gender Coordinator before proceeding to formal approval. Gender Focal Points assist colleagues in integrating gender equality and women’s empowerment aspects into their programmes and projects including department-specific guidance on the identification of gender-sensitive outcomes and outputs and of sex-disaggregated indicators, and use of gender responsive implementation, monitoring and evaluation practices. It is not evident that all projects have explicitly addressed gender within the intervention design in practice. Evaluations of UNIDO programmes undertaken in 2017-18 in Colombia, India and Nigeria found that integration of gender equality into UNIDO programmes had not been effective. The India Country Programme evaluation found that “little effort was placed on targeting or gender-specific approaches”. It is possible that there is a time lag between the recently introduced emphasis on gender mainstreaming in 2016 and its impact on projects.<br>Environment is more frequently addressed than other cross-cutting issues in practice, reflecting the fact that many of UNIDO’s projects are specifically connected with environment and climate due to GEF funding. The purpose of many of UNIDO’s projects is to explicitly address environmental, energy or climate change issues, and therefore they are underpinned by analysis of relevant environmental issues. <br>Monitoring for cross-cutting issues is not consistently identified in project documents. In several country programmes reviewed, it is stated that results will be disaggregated by gender, but data was not seen. Most country programmes and many projects have an intended environmental outcome (see Element 5 above), so that some environmental issues are de facto monitored as are poverty issues relevant to human rights when interventions address poverty reduction/earning capacity. UNIDO’s model is based on the concept that industrialisation and development reduce poverty. Governance and human rights are rarely mentioned or reported. The 2019 revised IRPF sets out indicators which will enable better assessment of UNIDO contributions to the cross-cutting issues, for instance through specific gender equality indicators and indicators on impacts on beneficiaries and stakeholders.',

In setting out the principles of the System, it is stated: “The Research Centers should be responsible for system functions that can be more efficiently and effectively executed by them and by CGIAR Research Programs and for the use of funds provided to them. Center Boards have legal, governance and fiduciary responsibilities of their own, and these must be fully recognised and respected.”<br>The CGIAR System Framework sets out the role of the Research Centers: “The Research Centers are independent and autonomous Organisations with their own governance structures, which focus on effective conduct, delivery and impact of the CGIAR research for development when working with CGIAR System Partners within the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework. The Research Centers deliver innovative research outcomes within the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework based on resources provided by the Funders, within the institutional architecture for international development including the Sustainable Development Goals.” <br>There is evidence from evaluations that the approach that has been taken has had a negative effect on the work of Research Centers. The 2017 Evaluation of Partnerships concluded: “The funding situation has generated a great deal of dissatisfaction and tension. Core funding through Windows 1 and 2, which was expected to provide a solid funding base underpinning research programs and strategic engagement in partnerships, has not materialised at the level expected, and has also been unreliable.”<br>The current business plan emphasises the importance of maintaining the independence of the Research Centers, stating: “[t]he plan does not, therefore, aspire to present Center-level strategies or aim to prescribe these… The actions identified below are using existing decision-making structures and roles established in the 2016 reforms, with the philosophy of subsidiarity in decision-making running across the approaches identified in the plan.”',

Proposed major changes to the scope and nature of activities foreshadowed in the project document should be referred to the Executive Committee for approval as part of the annual implementation plan for the subsequent year (MLF, 2017, Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria. 9.

Different procedures apply depending on whether the change is considered major or minor.

The head of RMS derives his managerial certifying authority for resources management – including XB-funding − from the head of UNCTAD.<br>In the area of TC, de facto decentralisation has encouraged delegation of decision-making authority to project managers to leverage resources if and when necessary. UNCTAD’s TC project approval and reporting processes illustrate how the main TC decisions are decentralised, with adequate due diligence processes. Programme managers are accountable for the delivery of TC outputs and results contained in the strategic framework and programme budget, and often undertake fundraising for their projects.<br>All requests for TC are stored in a centralised request database, accessible online. Once a decision is taken to proceed with the request and funding has been secured, it is processed internally through a transparent “Trust Fund Management System” that was introduced in 2016.<br>Subsequently, in 2018, UNCTAD launched the automated Trust Fund Document Approval system to streamline the review and approval processes of all project documents, memoranda of understanding and agreements.

    'value': 'There are organisational guidelines which describe the delegation of decision-making, but these are not adequate for clear accountability. UNIDO’s “Financial Regulations and Rules” and the Internal Control Framework (ICF) explain that allotment holders are normally the line, team or project manager and have full responsibility for the utilisation of the allotment. UNIDO’s Field Handbook provides insight into field office operations and co-ordination and budget management, but the 2018 external audit found room for improvement and “a need to enhance the Terms of Reference for UNIDO Field Offices to clearly describe in detail the reporting lines of country offices with UNIDO Country representatives to avoid the accountability traps and varying conjectures, as well as check the risk of excessive approval levels that impede decisions, thereby making the process more efficient” (13). It also recommends that the ICF itself be updated to “provide clarity of accountabilities on internal control management” (13). <br>Staff at HQ consider that delegation levels are clear. It is clearly determined, for instance, that project managers can spend up to EUR 40 000 without seeking authorisation and have the ability to revise project budgets within 15% to avoid micro-management from finance personnel; finance staff at HQ see their role as monitoring and ensuring coherence with donor requirements rather than control. HQ staff confirmed that there are system controls, as well as controls for finance and procurement, stating that “by the time the project is implemented there are no surprises as it was all planned that way”. <br>Staff within field offices do not commonly feel delegated authority is clear, sufficient or efficient. The allocation of the annual budget for field offices is made by the Operations Integration Division at HQ; it is not decentralised. Field staff note that processes for financial decision-making are not adequately delegated to the field, and that procedures to access funds are slow and cumbersome. In practice, representatives only have access to field office budgets and limited other funds; project funds are managed by HQ project managers (allotment holders). A decentralised procedure has been introduced for procurement which allows project managers (allotment holders) with delegated authority in field offices to manage medium value procurement requirements. <br>The Evaluation Synthesis 2012-15 found that decision-making bodies such as steering committees/co-ordination committees are not always put into place or operational for country programmes. Also, project documents are not always amended when budgets are reduced. This synthesis also found that implementation delays in programmes typically stem from UNIDO’s centralised decision-making and the time needed to transfer funds via multiple layers (HQ-regional-country levels). <br>Despite the 2018 restructuring with the field network becoming an integral part of the Programme Development and Technical Cooperation Division, there has been no change in the levels of delegated authority, or in the supporting programming processes. Although the field network is to play a leading role throughout the entire technical co-operation cycle including through the implementation of selected projects/programmes, how this will be done is not made clear. This is still work in progress. As a result, there is a continuing weakness in adjusting programmes to the needs of local contexts.',

    'value': 'Decentralised units and headquarters units can design and seek donor funding for programmes with a high degree of freedom. The ability of units to manage these interventions effectively influences how responsive UNODC can be; this is determined to a high degree by the way authority is delegated in UNODC. UNODC’s policy relating to the delegation of authority derives from the policies of the UN Secretariat. The Executive Director of UNODC receives authority from the UN Secretary-General. As the chief administrative officer under the Charter of the United Nations, the Secretary-General holds primary authority and accountability for the administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial Regulations and Rules. The Executive Director further delegates authority to reportees in their areas of responsibilities, and they in turn are empowered to further delegate authority (make sub-delegations). All delegations of authority are activated and recorded on an online portal.<br>In early 2019, the UN Secretariat issued a new delegated authority policy and guidance that was aimed at facilitating more efficient delivery. The new policy was issued to strengthen “decentralising decision-making, aligning authorities with responsibilities and strengthening accountability, and to delegate to managers the necessary managerial authority over human, financial and physical resources to allow for effective mandate delivery”. The document sets out the establishment of the new framework for the delegation of authority, rescinding existing delegations and sub-delegations of authority. The scope and detail of the Executive Director’s delegated authority are set out in a comprehensive way, covering issues relating to financing, human resource management and procurement. Whilst they do not directly address aid allocation and programming, they affect UNODC’s ability to manage programmes at decentralised levels and are highly relevant to this micro-indicator. UNODC had until 1 July 2019 to apply the new framework so, for this assessment, there was insufficient evidence available of how the new policy is being implemented in UNODC or its impact. It is for this reason that MI 3.3.4 has this element has been scored as “no evidence” (N/E).<br>UNODC has a pre-existing agreement with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to facilitate decentralised management in countries where UNDP carries out this function on behalf of UNODC. This agreement sets out which regulations apply in these countries, including with respect to staff responsibilities. <br>As of June 2019, there was a lack of clarity regarding how the new policy would be implemented – and whether it would lead to fundamental changes. Several interviews indicated that staff in management and delivery roles consider that UNODC currently gives insufficient decision-making autonomy at country or regional level. Several interviewees from headquarters and field entities alike expressed the view that UNODC is over-centralised and that the Division for Management takes a conservative approach to the application of UN Secretariat rules and guidelines: they considered that the application of rules and procedures impacts negatively on the ability to deliver effectively. Some went so far as to say, it “stops us delivering”. That there is an inadequate delegation of authority was a common view. Some considered that a proportion of programme support cost should be returned to programmes to help with their management. <br>Interviews with field office heads indicate that a significant number consider they have an inadequate delegation of authority to carry out their responsibilities. They are accountable for raising funds and administering programmes (delivery) but do not have enough authority to make decisions that allow them to implement these programmes. They consider that they are obliged to revert decisions on budget approval for hiring and procurement to the Division for Management when these powers should be delegated. It may be that once UNODC management has had the chance to consider and implement the new strategic direction set by the UN Secretariat, the concerns cited in this and the preceding paragraph will be resolved.<br>Concern was raised in UNODC that some elements of the UN Secretariat’s new delegation of authority guidelines – specifically those related to procurement – may have the reverse effect to those intended. There is concern they may lead to further centralisation in UNODC. The new guidelines on procurement may make it more rather than less difficult to decentralise procurement as it now requires any sub-delegation of procurement to be only to specialist procurement staff. UNODC does not have enough specialists in its field offices to ensure decentralised procurement. UNODC is representing its concerns to the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support to seek to mitigate this potential impact. <br><br>There is also evidence that UNODC management has taken reallocation or programming decisions that have led to stronger delivery. Once a year, the Programme Steering Committees is supposed to review annual strategic targets, priorities and resources. The assessment team reviewed evidence of the PSC Regional Programme for Central Asia taking a strategic approach to streamlining delivery. UNODC also reallocated funds to a limited number of “surge countries”, to enable it to participate more effectively in new opportunities created by the UN development system reform, as a one-off response to needs. An evaluation of UNODC’s global programme on money-laundering shows that the increasing placement of mentors directly in the countries had positive effects on UNODC’s delivery; the evaluation of the Global Maritime Crime Programme, which is based in Sri Lanka, underlined aspects relating to positive effects. Constraints to procurement in UNODC’s large Colombian operation, highlighted by an audit, were resolved following the intervention of the Procurement Unit. <br>UNODC’s partners appear to consider that UNODC staff are sufficiently empowered. Of survey respondents, 51% think that staff can make critical strategic and programmatic decisions locally.',

    'value': 'Each of the 15 Research Centers has its own performance assessment system for staff. There is a CGIAR Human Resources Community of Practice that brings together all of the human resources (HR) heads of the Research Centers to share experience. The current business plan sets out a process of reform for people management that is currently underway, to be developed for the next business plan cycle.<br>As part of this people management strategy, one of the objectives is the consolidation of System-wide HR data and metrics as part of the wider performance measurement, information management and accountability mechanisms. Information about the performance assessment systems for the Research Centers is not currently made public, although there is some evidence of their ad hoc use. <br>Again, in the plans for the people management strategy in the current business plan, one of the objectives is to “[d]evelop a diverse, high-performing and engaged workforce, with the right mix of skills and expertise to deliver on CGIAR’s vision, in a rapidly evolving operational context, and strategically deployed to maximise the impact of our work.”<br>The 2017 Evaluation of Gender in the Workplace found from HR Directors’ responses “[t]hat the majority of Research Centers have in place, at least to a moderate extent, policies and procedures that foster transparency and consistency in the processes for performance reviews and promotions.

    'value': 'The MLF Secretariat is a co-located entity and is administratively part of UNEP. Headquarters (HQ) interviews confirmed that the MLF Secretariat uses the HR systems and policies of UNEP, including the performance assessment system. Therefore, this assessment refers to the MOPAN assessment of UNEP produced in 2015-16. The UNEP assessment provided an overall rating of satisfactory for this MI, on the following basis:<br>“There is evidence that UNEP has designed comprehensive HR systems and policies that are performance-based and geared to the achievement of programme results, including with regard to gender and evaluation. UNEP applies the United Nations (UN) Performance Management and Development System and the UN Performance Appraisal System and has systems and guidance in place to incorporate these into its operating model. UN System-wide Action Plan assessments suggest that this is starting to have the desired effect on practice within UNEP. However, the extent to which actual practice supports organisational relevance, agility and results delivery is not clear. Evidence from interviews suggested that HR systems are not applied rigorously or consistently, particularly during staff performance appraisals. As such, performance appraisal is not necessarily performance-based or well linked to organisational results.”<br>The draft 2019 MOPAN assessment rated UNIDO as satisfactory for this MI. The 2015-16 MOPAN assessments for UNDP and the World Bank also rated performance as satisfactory.',

There are mid-point and end-of-cycle evaluations using an automated e-performance system (E-pas), available on UNCTAD’s intranet. Performance progress and compliance is linked to the UNCTAD’s management information systems known as the dashboard. Performance is monitored closely, and users can see E-performance document status by division on a monthly basis. There has been a backlog in E-pas compliance for quite some time. The HR section sends regular reminders, and the dashboard has contributed to greater transparency.<br>As for consultants, performance appraisals are carried out at the end of the assignment, for internal use only. These assessments are not shared with the consultants. E-performance is one input for staff promotion decisions. UNCTAD follows the UN Secretariat guidance, rules and regulations on staff disagreements and complaints regarding performance assessments, as well as other grievance instances; this is done on a case-by-case basis.<br>A 2017 OIOS audit on the use of consultants and individual contractors at the UNCTAD assessed the adequacy and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes over the recruitment and use of contractors/consultants. The audit found that there were satisfactory arrangements to ensure that engagements were temporary in nature, that there were adequate controls to ensure that terms of reference for consultants had specific and measurable deliverables and that selections were based on established criteria. However, controls relating to competitive selection, verification of credentials, monitoring of payments and tracking of unsatisfactory performance/prevention of rehiring needed to be strengthened. UNCTAD accepted all related recommendations and took adequate measures.<br>UNCTAD has very limited financial resources to provide training opportunities and allow for staff mobility. Instead, it has sought other ways to refresh and renew staff skills, including facilitating requests for outside activities such as teaching at tertiary institutions; facilitating requests for sabbaticals/studies; facilitating TC with educational institutions for capacity building, training<br>and implementation of technical projects; facilitating inter-divisional discussions on key research topics; research seminars; on-the-job training for staff on results-based management; and facilitating training on the UN Development Account to strengthen the capacity of UNCTAD staff in designing and implementing Development Account projects.',

    'value': 'UNIDO’s Human Resource Management Framework (HMRF) of 2015 recognises a Staff Performance Management System (PMS) as “a basis for recognizing different levels of performance and development needs and opportunities” (5). It is a comprehensive, results and competencies-based system for regular staff members at all levels and is almost entirely online. For short-term contracted personnel members, a performance system also exists but is “more modest” and based, for example, on ISAs for consultants. HR interviewees mentioned they are working on calibration of the PMS to ensure consistency and are also looking at moving away from a number-based rating system. <br>Staff performance is appraised according to results achieved over a calendar year using a three-stage cycle – start, end and mid-term review. At the beginning of the reporting period, the goals to be achieved by each individual staff member are identified and objectives entered on a central system. <br>All reviews must be endorsed by the manager’s manager, and 360-degree feedback is also used for general competencies. In 2018, the review completion rate was 65% which has decreased; interviewees stated that in past years it was 98%. There are incentives for completion, such as annual step increments, and disincentives for non-completion, such extension of appointments being put on hold. Some staff at HQ indicated that the system is not systematically used by all managers. <br>Staff at HQ explained how the Framework for PMS supports alignment between individual results and the DG’s annual priorities which are cascaded down via the organisation’s three managing directors; individual goals and objectives are thus related to management priorities, but there is not a clear link to the IRPF. <br>UNIDO’s Talent Planning, Acquisition and Development Division (CMO/HRM/PAD) “promotes and implements strategic organisational policies aimed at improving the planning, acquisition, development, engagement, motivation and retention of the human resources required for the Organisation’s mandate” (33). There remains a challenge for UNIDO in achieving the necessary skill and talent mix since in practice, due to resource constraints, new posts are frequently filled by promoting existing staff members to avoid both external recruitment and redundancy. This limits the ability of UNIDO to meet identified organisational improvement requirements, for instance to move away from a technical to a strategic and relational way of working.<br>Training needs assessments (TNAs) of staff are undertaken and individual/corporate training plans developed on an annual basis with each staff member having an individual personal development plan. TNAs are related to organisational priorities.<br>The HRMF states, “Excellent performance is the paramount consideration for the promotion of staff members” (51). Staff performance assessment is used for recognising and rewarding performance through various types of promotions, merit awards of monetary or non-monetary form and other awards such as the Director General’s Award for Exemplary Excellence. Staff at HQ confirmed that they were invited to nominate colleagues to receive such awards.<br>HR staff interviewed also described a rebuttal process for complaints about their performance assessment if and when they receive ratings lower than 3. This is reviewed by an independent panel with the final appraisal done by the HR director. <br>Staff expressed concerns around HR issues such as maternity leave and the difficulties for employees to obtain flexible working time or flexibility for childcare commitments. They were also concerned about accessibility of the Vienna International Centre and the “check-in check-out system” which is considered quite dated. The importance of flexible working arrangements to promote more effective and efficient working was raised. Most staff only have a desktop computer, which does not facilitate flexi- and teleworking.',

    'value': 'Intervention designs include the analysis of gender equality and human rights as cross-cutting issues and of governance as a key contextual factor. As noted in MI 2.1d, UNODC has only recently spelt out its policy on gender mainstreaming, so it is likely that its inclusion in intervention designs will be stronger in future. <br>UNODC’s Programme and Operations Manual sets out guidance notes for gender mainstreaming and for human rights; UNODC’s project document template requires interventions to address key questions relating to both of these cross-cutting issues. Given that almost all of UNODC’s interventions concern governance, this is implicit. No guidance on the integration of the issue of the environment was found. Clear guidelines are available on human rights and gender equality.<br>As indicated in MI 2.1d, UNODC states that its Programme Review Committee ensures that all programmes comply with human rights-related requirements through its Human Rights Advisory Group, which addresses HRDDP implementation and provides advice to UNODC’s Executive Director. Some interviewees were not confident that, in practice, scrutiny was undertaken as consistently and robustly as necessary or that some interventions in sensitive areas could progress without enough robust scrutiny. This assessment did not have the scope to review the extent to which these concerns were justified and simply noted this view. <br>UNODC’s Guidance Note for staff on gender mainstreaming clearly sets out how to conduct a gender analysis for needs assessments, situational analysis, stakeholder assessment and problem analysis. While this guidance was issued in 2013, UNODC only confirmed an implementation plan for mainstreaming gender equality at the end of 2018. Thus, implementation is still in its early stages. As part of the United Nations system, UNODC is obligated to ensure that a gender perspective is actively and visibly mainstreamed into all its practices, policies and programmes. The Programme and Operations Manual states that “many programmes, projects and activities still weakly address gender concerns or are even completely gender blind.”<br>Intervention designs do not yet include the analysis of environmental sustainability and climate change issues; however, the vast majority of UNODC interventions do not have a significant relationship with these issues. The exception is interventions that involve introducing alternative crops to drug cultivation.<br>Designs generally explore governance issues related to the intervention. They tend to include political economy analysis. <br>Intervention plans reviewed state that gender equality and human rights will be examined in the programme evaluation. If cross-cutting issues are embedded in projects’ logframes as outputs or indicators, they will be captured as a matter of routine in evaluations. However, there is limited evidence that they are assessed in ongoing monitoring.',

    'value': 'Given the nature of most projects under the Montreal Protocol (the reduction of ODS), intervention designs include by default aspects of sustainability, such as technical developments, phase-out strategies and impacts on the environment. The Executive Committee Primer (2019) describes how funding under the Protocol is “based on a commitment by the country to achieve sustainable, permanent reductions in consumption and production of controlled substances”. However, the document review found all MLF documents to contain multiple references to sustainable reductions but no overarching statement on an approach to/definition of sustainability. The MLF Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria’s Project Proposals chapter (2017) reports that “the Fortieth Meeting of the Executive Committee decided to request implementing and bilateral agencies to indicate qualitatively in all relevant reports, especially those related to tranches of funding, the extent to which reductions in phase-out had been influenced by factors external to<br>the project in the country concerned”. This policy document also urges bilateral and implementing agencies to “complete a thorough analysis of the technical, economic, financial, co-funding and environmental issues associated with the replacement, and to demonstrate the economic viability and long-term sustainability prior to submitting a request for approval” for their activities.<br>Interviews with HQ staff described how key elements of enabling policy are defined in intervention design as a matter of course in practice.

    'value': 'TC interventions vary in quality and approach, ranging from one-off interventions in traditional areas like training courses and workshops, to long-term relationships (ASYCUDA, DMFAS). Many TC interventions aim to strengthen existing national systems. Sustainability – in the sense that the benefits of the project are expected to continue after its completion – is addressed in the project document design template: “The document describes measures that should be in place for the project to continue delivering benefits after implementation (sustainability measures)”.<br>In practice, results are mixed. The evaluation of subprogramme 4 (Technology and Logistics) identified several good practices related to incorporating institutional sustainability considerations into TC activities. These include Train for Trade alumni networks, the focus on organisational strengthening of national trade facilitation committees, as well as the ASYCUDA approach to building institutional capacity, for example, by supporting the set-up of training centres. However, the same evaluation also identified a key challenge regarding the sustainability of ASYCUDA, in that it relies on strictly earmarked extrabudgetary resources, which could not be utilised for necessary investments in software development and upgrades, essential for meeting the evolving technological needs of countries in the longer term. This illustrates a recurrent challenge to UNCTAD’s efforts to achieve sustainable results, namely the lack of (unearmarked) resources.<br>Other evaluations found evidence of some likelihood of sustainability of the TC interventions they had examined. However, to better enable sustainability of results and to respond to the sustainability concerns of donors, strong national ownership and engagement, as well as adopting a programmatic rather than project approach, were recommended. Aftercare support and follow-up reviews (after a number of years) to assess policy implementation could also contribute to sustainability of results, for which extrabudgetary resources would be required.<br>Sustainability pathways are not clearly articulated in project documents; nor were they clearly expressed by staff during interviews. Given the large number of one-off interventions, sustainability is not always seen an integral consideration in project design.<br>Nevertheless, respondents to the partner survey speak favourably of the attention given to sustainability during the design stages, with more than 90% stating that UNCTAD’s TC interventions are designed and implemented to sustain effect over time. Again, this would appear to contrast with the findings of the project sample review which point out that statements of sustainability are generally not explicit in the project documents or are quite lightly considered in terms of whether the proposed initiative is itself sustainable without further funding. There was some evidence of political issues as a risk to sustainability. There are notable shortcomings in the inclusion of sustainability in monitoring and evaluation frameworks, including of UNDAF-related projects.',

    'value': 'UNIDO interventions are framed by a commitment to sustainability as set out in its two governing principles: SDG 9 and ISID. At concept note stage, sustainability is reviewed in the UR submission and focuses on the institutional sustainability of the initiative. The Programme and Project Formulation and Approval Function process (2016) requires all projects to be assessed for institutional sustainability and counterpart support. The process does not clearly define sustainability approaches necessary to sustain benefits. This is noted in the Nigeria country programme evaluation which finds that “various components of the theme promote sustainability through the local capacity they build while sustainability approaches remain unclear in other aspects” (34). UNIDO GEF projects define benefits and sustainable outcomes more explicitly from design stage, as required by GEF guidelines.<br>There are examples of where in practice the intervention addresses sustainability, although the extent to which this is done and what is understood as sustainability is variable. For instance, the value chain approach for trade champions sustainability standards so that a fair price to producers and every partner in the value chain is maintained to ensure sustainable operations. Interventions directed to building capacity and access to finance similarly build potential for sustainability, as do pilots designed to support regional or national scale-up of interventions. Sustainability is to some extent defined in project design in the context analysis and outline of assumptions; for instance, development of public-private partnerships is seen as at risk if the relevant government does not prepare an adequate legal framework for it. The PCPs have enabled countries to effectively mobilise significant funding from donors as well as domestic and private sector sources. <br>UNIDO does not have a well-articulated definition or conceptualisation of sustainability and the assumptions that underpin it, which weakens potential for its evaluation. Scale-up is often a stated commitment, but what is being scaled up and how, whether it is behaviours, funding or skills, is not defined and is variably interpreted. Sustainability outcomes for individual projects is often not well defined at the outset. An identified issue exemplified in the Colombia country evaluation is the “lack of an impact and sustainability perspective in the formulation of the initiatives that have affected the sustainability of the same” (73). Monitoring systems often do not encourage work oriented beyond the activities and products and are focused on the operational dimension. A further challenge can be that “there is insufficient attention paid to results (outcomes and impact)” (71) as found by the country evaluation of Thailand. Sustainability of industrial development policies supported by UNIDO is not articulated or measured. As a result, governments do not always give UNIDO due credit for its support and interventions. <br>Country programmes refer to UNIDO support in the development of industrial or related strategies; however, evaluations find these need to be better based in country political and policy contexts. The Colombia country evaluation notes that a lesson learned is to pay more attention to political and regulatory reforms to achieve large-scale transformations. The 2018 evaluation of the Nigeria Country Programme, identified political and financial challenges which put some thematic areas at risk of not being sustained. Lack of government ownership for interventions was noted as a risk to sustainability in several country evaluations.',

    'value': 'UNODC’s interventions include both normative/standard-setting programmes and country-level programmes. Much of UNODC’s normative work, particularly its support to countries to implement international conventions and related protocols, is aimed at ensuring an enabling policy or legal environment is in place and that these are sufficiently robust to be readily implemented. UNODC carries out this role with respect to a broad range of conventions (see KPI 1). Its ability to support reform processes using its regular budget in all jurisdictions has been limited by resource constraints; but where extrabudgetary funds have been committed, it has been able to provide consistent and targeted support. <br>Due to UNODC’s mandate to support the implementation of conventions, much work is undertaken by units that focuses on gathering routine feedback and compiling reports on compliance. The UNCAC and the three conventions underpinning the legal framework on drug control and the eight international conventions signed under its auspices generate the greatest demands. In interviews, some interlocutors noted that this absorbs a huge amount of work and financial resources (particularly in meetings). They felt there was scope to save time and financial resources by revisiting how it conducts reporting for compliance. <br>UNODC’s programme and operations manual explicitly states that all intervention designs should consider sustainability issues, and the project document template obliges designs to address them. This requirement applies to global-, regional- and country-level interventions. The global, regional and country project documents reviewed do contain statements on aspects of sustainability, including issues around the institutional framework. They are of varying depth and coverage but do tend to address the most relevant concerns for the intervention – and recognise the need to institutionalise the practices and capacities supported. <br>Most of UNODC’s interventions themselves build the key elements of the enabling policy and legal environment that are needed to sustain expected benefits. They are therefore defined in intervention designs. Policy support (Subprogramme 7) is one of UNODC’s main thematic priorities: it aims “to advance institutional reform and strengthen policy and operational responses by Member States on drug control, crime prevention and criminal justice”.<br>Interventions outlined in UNODC’s Programme and Budget document and UNODC’s regional and country programmes are explicit about the global, regional and national policies that they help to build. These are identified as both target outcomes in themselves and as supporting conditions for specific interventions. UNODC’s global-level work to encourage national governments to implement various commitments and conventions is one way that UNODC supports this “enabling environment”. This aspect is arguably one of UNODC’s key strengths and contributions.<br>The critical assumptions that underpin sustainability are generally examined in intervention evaluations – as required by UNODC’s Evaluation Policy.<br>UNODC‘s interventions show evidence of its attempts to support shifts in policy and legislation in a proactive way. One of many examples is from the cluster evaluation of UNODC’s law enforcement and border control programme in Central Asia, which facilitated the development of legislation that also led countries to sign up to international conventions. UNODC also successfully uses research and analysis to further identify the nature of a problem and identify potential solutions. The Safety Audit in Cali, Colombia, is an example of the use of research to identify what policy steps are needed to address a problem.',

    'value': 'Internal standards are in place to track the speed of implementation in the form of a consolidated progress report, which examines and explains any delays. The MLF reports on the average time from approval to the first disbursement. The MLF Executive Committee Primer (2018) reports that “there were a total of 269 ongoing investment projects under implementation at the end of 2017. These projects, on average, are experiencing a delay of 26 months”.<br>The document review found no evidence of the MLF benchmarking speed of implementation internally (e.g. intervention speed in low-income vs. medium-income countries) or externally (e.g. implementation speed of Montreal Protocol funded interventions vs. Global Environment Facility [GEF] funded interventions).<br>The MLF Report of the 82nd meeting of the Executive Committee (2018) states that “one member said that … she was concerned by the large number of delays in project implementation and the consequent need for additional status reports. While some of those delays had been caused by security issues in the country, other delays were unrelated and needed to be explained. HFC enabling projects had not started yet and action needed to be taken in that respect, and on the other projects, as soon as possible”. Interviews with HQ staff described the process of submission, <br>comments, redraft and resubmission of project documents as a time-consuming process. An interview with the UNDP Montreal Protocol unit suggested that the Montreal Protocol has more technical requirements than the Global Environment Facility and is very technical and compliance-driven. It was suggested that “every change has to be approved by the Secretariat, even very small ones”. While time-consuming, this was also referred to in HQ and IA interviews as providing very clear guidance on expectations and requirements. On a more negative note, one IA described MLF databases as “antiquated and hard to use”. The Secretariat stated that the Fund is extremely fast at making the resources available to IAs to operate and implement projects as soon as they are approved and that financial procedures have not hindered implementation. The EXCOM has exercised flexibility by considering proposals in advance of their due meeting in order to avoid hindering the speed of implementation.<br>There is some evidence from the document review that MLF has taken steps in the past to improve on identified bottlenecks. The Twenty-second Meeting of the Executive Committee (1998) introduced rules to review and address implementation and completion delays, and a comprehensive review of project delays was made in 2002 (EXCOM document 36/15). Documents reviewed for this assessment found information on delays by country and IA but very limited information on the explicit steps being taken to identify overarching/common causes for the delays, the steps taken to address them or on improvement in the speed of implementation over time. The Secretariat affirmed that specific reasons for project and tranche submission delays are identified and addressed, and there is evidence of a systematic process to identify and address project delays. HQ interviews described how the project management unit is essential for any reduction project – it monitors, organises, reports, plans etc. – and how this creates a “self-cleaning mechanism”, monitored by the MLF. A detailed budget is submitted for each tranche request, and funding adjustments (such as a reduction in project funds to make up for a shortfall caused by high administrative costs) are made. Every project is monitored from beginning to end, with deviations requiring an explanation and a suitable response. All unused, or unneeded, funds are required to be returned – “down to the dollar”. However, the extent to which this process successfully addresses identified bottlenecks is not made explicit in the documentation reviewed for this assessment. The Secretariat stated that information on how delays were addressed is contained in individual project completion reports.',

    'value': 'Like other entities of the UN Secretariat, UNCTAD follows UN Secretariat business processes and uses its tools, including Umoja. Based on documentation and interview responses, it would appear that UNCTAD’s institutional procedures are efficient and allow for swift action. For instance, on grants management (i.e. any activity linked to management and support of the projects or grants funded by XB resources), the average request completion by type of service and client (in days) during the period January-June 2019 was 1.7 days for financial transactions. Another example is the drop in the average number of days for completion of requests in the Trust Fund Documents System from 27.4 days in 2018 to 20.8 days in 2019. UNCTAD has fully delegated authority to manage consultants and processes consultancies within 10 days on average.<br>Nonetheless, UN Secretariat processes and instruments are not always well appreciated by staff. Umoja is seen as cumbersome and rigid, despite recent improvements. The financial administration is viewed as setting unrealistic demands that not all projects can meet (e.g. participants must have a bank account), leading to unnecessary efficiency losses. As a UN Secretariat entity, UNCTAD is not tailored to deliver projects in difficult conditions.<br>The introduction and use of the MIS Dashboard, UNCTAD’s management information system, has increased internal efficiency, transparency and communication. The monthly dashboard updates include information on regular budget post and non-post resources and expenditure rates, issues with funding/cash availability against margins, and supporting information/action points so that divisions can carefully plan expenditure or recruitment. These form the basis for discussion between the head of RMS, divisional directors and the OSG around resource use and allocation. Moreover, RMS, which does the monitoring on expenditure, project ending, etc., provides bi-monthly reports to Project Officers, or more often if required.<br>Partner survey responses suggest there is general appreciation for timely implementation, with nearly 70% of respondents stating that organisational procedures do not cause delays for implementing partners.',

    'value': 'As part of the UN Secretariat, UNODC is obliged to adhere to all the Secretariat’s policies and procedures relating to performance management. The UN Secretariat’s policy, effective since 2010, is comprehensive and addresses all standard aspects of performance management. It applies to all staff below the level of the Executive Director. The Executive Director reports directly to the Secretary-General. Adherence to the policy is mandatory. Performance improvement plans are put in place where there is staff underperformance. <br>All staff are obliged to have a workplan in place on the Inspira system, an Oracle-based platform that holds the entire performance management system, covering an annual period from 1 April of any given year to 31 March of the succeeding year. There is supposed to be a six-monthly and an annual assessment against their workplan. The assessment team did not have access to compliance rates, but indirect evidence indicates that the policy is largely implemented. The current Human Resources Management Section Action Plan contains a workstream aimed at strengthening performance management compliance. <br>There is a Senior Compact between the Executive Director and the UN Secretary-General. The Compact includes two human resources (HR) management performance measures: one related to timely recruitment, the other to UNODC’s compliance with the Secretariat’s performance management policies.<br>UNODC’s Human Resources Management Section has carried out training to encourage stronger compliance with policy and to improve the quality of performance management across the organisation: it facilitated many performance management workshops in 2018 and 2019. UNODC stated it is piloting 360-degree reporting between April and September 2019. This type of reporting is not a requirement of the UN Secretariat’s human resources policy. <br>UN Secretariat policy is to ensure there is a direct link between human resources management and the strategic objectives of entities – as a means of reinforcing results-based management. Staff agree on workplans with their line managers, and these are supposed to be based on the objectives of the organisation and their unit’s results. UNODC’s objectives are embedded in the Compact between the Executive Director and the Secretary-General and are then cascaded down through the organisational hierarchy in the performance management system. <br>There is evidence that formal staff objectives are aligned with the strategic aims of the organisation. For example, the Director of Operations encouraged subordinate staff to add a specific goal, with related actions, in their 2019-20 workplans that would help drive coherence and collaboration with the emergent UN development system reform. However, a significant number of interviews indicated a perception that performance which, in practice, is rewarded through promotion relates to fundraising. A number of interviewees considered that staff are “judged on the basis of your ability to attract funds”. This is a logical consequence of UNODC’s dependence on individual programme managers being responsible for securing funding for their programmes. This incentive is also likely to lead to competition rather than collaboration across the organisation.<br>The UN Secretariat’s policies and procedures relating to performance management set out a clear process for the management of disagreements and complaints relating to staff performance assessments. UNODC tracks records of complaints and has done so since 2014. In handling disagreements or complaints about the performance management and development process, staff and/or supervisors can also contact the UN Secretariat Regional Ombudsman, located in Vienna.',

There does not appear to be an explicit secretariat-wide organisational statement or policy that clearly defines criteria for allocating resources to partners. On average, expenditure on LDCs in the period between 2015 and 2018 accounted for 47.3% of the total; approximately one-third of this involved LDC participation in regional and interregional projects. In terms of thematic priorities, UNCTAD’s TC Toolbox identifies no less than 28 different products.<br>As a UN Secretariat entity, UNCTAD operates within UN Secretariat regulations and rules, and it applies these rigorously and efficiently.

There are no explicit criteria for allocation of UNIDO funds for technical co-operation which would enable relative prioritisation of projects to select for development and implementation. Its operating model is based on direct implementation by UNIDO in the large majority of projects, rather than working through implementing partners, although this is now being piloted. The Programme and Budget for 2020-21 is a budget “in transition” to be aligned gradually to the new MTPF/IRPF. This has the potential to enable a more strategic prioritisation of funding. There are no standardised targets for disbursement or payments, and concerns were identified on the timeliness of payments and the impact on implementation. The 2020-21 Programme and Budget sets out the intent to align resources to results. There is still a gap between ambition and practice. Non-project-based activities are not currently subject to results-based assessment, costings or reporting.<br>External audits are conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.

These resources are allocated in line with its budget and are rarely allocated to partners.<br>UNODC does seek to apply principles of results-based budgeting. Its systems for doing this are relatively mature.

We will periodically review these investments in light of new political, demographic and climate change imperatives so that our research is aligned to major development goals.”<br>The decline in funding to W1/W2 funds in 2015 meant that budgets allocated to the CRPs had to be reduced substantially, resulting in considerable instability for the Research Centers. A significant proportion of survey respondents (almost 30%) rated the flexibility of CGIAR’s funding as fairly, very or extremely poor.

    'value': 'The UNCTAD mandate forms the basis for all its work, including TC. UNCTAD has a clearly defined and publicly available policy on how its TC is determined, and which priority countries it seeks to serve through its TC pillar. Basic principles of UNCTAD TC are that it is demand-driven, embraces country ownership, and is transparent, efficient, effective and implemented in a geographically balanced manner.<br>TC targets all developing countries, in particular LDCs, Africa, LLDCs, SIDSs and other vulnerable and small economies. In practice, this is where the majority of resources are directed, either directly or through interregional programmes. However, targeting is broad; in practice, prioritisation and implementation are wholly dependent on the availability of funding, of which over 90% are provided by bilateral donors and often earmarked. Interviews indicated that, whereas UNCTAD keeps track of where demand is coming from and how this evolves, this does not necessarily translate into strategic choices. Instead, donor priorities, rather than UNCTAD’s or targeted member states’ priorities, ultimately determine where and how much TC is delivered.<br>Based on documentation and interviews, and in light of the de facto decentralised structure and work processes, there does not appear to be an explicit secretariat-wide organisational statement or policy that clearly defines criteria for allocating resources to partners. Further, interviews suggest that there is not a formalised approach and instead each division has developed its own. Once a decision is taken to proceed with the request, it is processed internally through a transparent trust fund management system that was introduced in 2016. Noting that UNCTAD’s mandate is very broad, practically all requests from member states for TC are registered in the TC database. Most interviewees note that donor preferences and priorities also directed funding allocation to countries or to specific thematic areas.<br>Between 2015 and 2018, UNCTAD expended the highest proportion of funds in the LDCs (47.3%) and Africa (34.4%) noting that there would be some cross-over between the two categories. Approximately one-third of this involved LDC participation in regional and interregional projects. Average overall expenditure between 2015 and 2018 was as follows: 34.4% to Africa, 16.5% to Asia and the Pacific, 11.3% to Latin America and the Caribbean, 5.5% to Europe and 0.3% to North America; 32% were spent on interregional TC. Of the 2018 expenses on TC, 22.3% were spent on low-income countries, 13.9% on lower-middle-income countries, 12.2% on upper-middle-income countries, 2.8% on high-income countries, 16% on regional TC interventions and 32.8% on interregional TC interventions. This pattern of expenditure has been consistent since 2015, though expenditure in Asia and the Pacific has steadily increased, and there was a USD 2 million increase for Africa between 2015 and 2016.<br>In terms of thematic priorities, UNCTAD’s TC Toolbox identifies 28 different products. Besides these, UNCTAD also supports occasional requests for TC assistance that are not part of the Toolbox (in 2018, 4% of total expenditures). The Toolbox is reviewed every two years. In the absence of specific allocation criteria, proxy information to describe where the resources are allocated show that in 2018, ASYCUDA and DMFAS combined were responsible for 58% of total expenditures (47% and 11%, respectively). They are followed by business facilitation (6.35%), E-Commerce and the Digital Economy (5.26%), and competition and consumer protection policies and frameworks (4.36%), which, combined, accounted for 16% of total UNCTAD TC delivery.<br>In sum, the TC policy and criteria are clearly defined and available, and the Toolbox, reflecting these, is regularly updated. In practice, however, funding availability, rather than specific selection criteria, is the actual driver of TC.',

    'value': 'During 2018, UNIDO introduced tracking for all projects to provide a Red Amber Green (RAG) rating on progress. There is an intent to have a RAG dashboard for all projects. Individual project timelines for implementation are used to assess whether or not the project is on track. There is no standard guidance on project implementation timeframes; these are largely handled by the project manager on a case-by-case basis. At present there is no systematic assessment of speed of project implementation, and rate of implementation is not reported in the annual report. <br>UNIDO does not benchmark its performance on speed of implementation across different operating contexts. The synthesis of evaluations 2015-18 found that 65% of evaluated projects experienced delays; two-thirds of these were delayed by more than 12 months.<br>Delays are due both to UNIDO management and to government and contextual factors. Evidence from evaluations of country programmes indicates that procedural delays are a significant challenge (see also MI 11.2). Delays predominantly occurred during late design and early implementation and related to appointment of staff, tendering processes and identification of target beneficiaries. The cause of delays is not always identified, but where specified they typically related to pre-implementation negotiations and insufficient dialogue with countries and formalisation of arrangements. Other sources of delay included project fund management requirements, release of funds, project staff appointments. External factors such as late payments from countries, national staff turnover and political change are also major contributors to delay.<br>UNIDO’s highly centralised model, combined with multiple layers of accountability and a lack of delegated authority to the UR/UCR (see also MI 3.3), is a continuing obstacle to timely decision-making at the field level. Evaluations have reported delays as being due to the management of most projects from Vienna at HQ. UCRs have to report to the regional or sub-regional office/cluster office first, before accessing the regional chief in HQ, so there is a double layer of accountability. The 2016 evaluation of procurement made a recommendation that “UNIDO should further implement its decentralization plan in operations at the country level by devolving much decision-making, budget authority and procurement process to the field, to improve efficiency and enable fast-track procedures that are required in post-crisis situations.” URs/UCRs observed that they have to find proactive ways to work around the system to ensure that they can access the resources and decisions necessary to do their jobs. While there has been a move to more regular communications and co-ordination with the field since 2018, communications between Vienna and field offices are still in need of improvement.<br>Some delays are seen to arise from procurement processes. Lack of capacity is a continuing challenge for the procurement team. There are also reported procurement delay factors at country level, for instance where buildings are not ready to receive equipment and where consignments are left at the United Nations Development Programme office for UNIDO, and this is not communicated promptly. <br>The SAP system now makes payment processing much faster, but delays continue in procurement. Since 2017, there have been process improvements for procurement systems. These now use electronic processing, which enables speed and transparency. A contract management tool is now being developed. UNIDO is also exploring use of a global banking system to expedite country level payments. The global system is cheaper and quicker but requires an additional level of control from HQ, and UNIDO does not have the staff capacity to roll it out to all countries.',

    'value': 'The assessment finds there is mixed evidence on whether institutional procedures support or hinder the speed of implementation. UNODC’s systems are relatively proven and mature – they have been used to implement many high-volume programmes – both in HQ and in country contexts. However, interviews indicated that there is room for improvement, particularly in procurement but also in other areas. A significant number of interviewees considered that UNODC needs to improve its institutional procedures by modernising and streamlining its administrative and management systems. UNODC is obliged to remain within the guidance of UN Secretariat. This guidance is being revised but, at least in relation to new procurement guidance, may have the consequence of slowing down rather than accelerating implementation (as indicated in MI 3.3). According to UNODC staff, UNODC was not consulted by the UN Secretariat when it wrote the new policy.<br>No clear set of internal standards to track the speed of implementation were found, and systems do not appear to come together in a single tracker. However, UNODC does have various monitoring systems in place that are intended to pick up delays in implementation. These include monthly reviews of expenditures, a biannual review of implementation, the full cost recovery barometer, project/programme progress reports, expert working groups and a steering committee. Donors also require regular implementation and financial reports, and delays will trigger action. <br>The recruiting process and related timelines are monitored by UNODC’s Human Resources Management Section with regular status updates and reminders as to timelines. Timelines are also tracked and reported organisation-wide and Secretariat-wide in terms of performance. <br>Comprehensive dashboards are in place to measure the financial management performance of UNODC. UNODC has spreadsheets that record the time needed and taken for programme design, approval and implementation workflow. Data from these do not appear to be consolidated into dashboards, however.<br>Procedural delays do not appear to be a systemic problem. There are cases in which procedural delays have hindered the speed of implementation, but they – aside for the issue of procurement – do not comprise a pattern. Interviews indicated that slow procurement impedes delivery; at least six interviewees identified this as an issue. UNODC shared evidence demonstrating the action taken in response to implementation delays – showing how divisions have collaborated to resolve particularly critical problems. <br>Evidence was found that procedural delays have hindered the speed of implementation in some cases (e.g. Nigeria), but there is also evidence of delays leading to consolidated and relatively speedy remedial action (e.g. Pakistan). See MI 11.2 for evaluative evidence related to this element. <br>UNODC has a policy to recruit staff within 120 days from the date a post was registered. Some interviewees complained that because of the complexity of procedures, it is difficult to achieve this in practice.',

Partnerships are generally developed and maintained effectively through the approach to programming, where CGIAR makes good use of its comparative advantage as an international organisation, while maintaining flexibility and agility through implementation by Research Centers. The resources that are available through W1 and W2 funding have been used, in the main, strategically to leverage the resources that partners at national, regional and international levels are able to provide. At the same time, CRPs have also worked strategically to expand the range of partners, particularly working with the private sector. CGIAR plays an important role internationally in terms of the production of knowledge products and open access data, perhaps most notably through the Genebank Platform.

    'value': 'Joint working with other organisations is an intrinsic part of how the Montreal Protocol is delivered. The Executive Committee Primer (2018) describes how “bilateral cooperation encompasses the full range of projects and activities funded under the Multilateral Fund. Project proposals from bilateral agencies are submitted by the donor country and are usually presented in a single bilateral cooperation document together with the Secretariat’s reviews of and recommendations on these project proposals”. Working with the IAs is central to how the Montreal Protocol is delivered. This review considers partnerships as those between the IAs of the Montreal Protocol and national authorities. The MLF has no partners because of its unique role – its sole remit is to follow the instructions of the Executive Committee, and it only interacts with the IAs. Mechanisms are in place to allow IAs to make programming adjustments as required, and reviews points exist between the MLF and IAs through regular meetings and in the reviews of requests for new tranches of funding.<br>This assessment considers the partnerships that exist between the IAs and national authorities. The links between the Secretariat and IAs are seen as internal to the Fund and are not generally considered to be partnerships. The exception relates to MI 6.2, where the comparative advantage of the four IAs – in effect “internal partnerships” – was taken as the most appropriate<br>interpretation of the methodology. It is uncertain to what extent the internal partnerships between MLF and IAs are aligned to comparative advantage. MLF documents provide some details on the differences in roles of the IAs, though without offering an explicit statement regarding competitive advantage. In practice, all IAs are expected to perform all types of projects under the IA. The selection of an IA to work with is at the discretion of the national authority. Each IA has its own area of expertise, although the national authority’s selection of an IA may be based on a number of factors beyond comparative advantage.<br>Adherence to the Busan Partnership for Effective Developments is considered non-applicable in the context of the MLF.<br>Key MLF documents make no reference to “leverage” or “synergy”. However, one of the key concepts of the Multilateral Fund is that it provides financing for the incremental costs of the phase-out of substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol. This is, by definition, leveraging the use of resources.<br>Joint working with other organisations is an intrinsic part of how the Montreal Protocol is delivered. Shared information gaps between the bodies of the Montreal Protocol, IAs and national authorities are addressed at the twice-annual meetings of the Executive Committee, at Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, and at other meetings/workshops with IAs and NOUs.<br>All relevant current information is available on the MLF website, although it was the opinion of the assessment team that MLF/Montreal Protocol documents are not produced in a manner which is clear and accessible to external audiences. All relevant information on budgeting, management, etc. is available from the MLF, and there are no indications that it is inaccurate or that it is not in line with relevant reporting guidelines. Management information/reporting available from the MLF is weakened by a lack of focus on analysis. For example, specific delays in project implementation are reported and acted upon, but no overall analysis of underlying causes was identified.<br>The MLF is a financial mechanism of the Montreal Protocol, with legal personality to provide financial and technical assistance to Article 5 countries to comply with the control measures set out in the Protocol. As such, accountability to beneficiaries is considered non-applicable to the MLF.<br>All reporting of results of Montreal Protocol funded activities is a joint enterprise between the MLF and the relevant IA. It is unclear from documentation the extent to which national authorities are involved in assessments of interventions. Consolidated progress reports summarising progress and financial information provided by bilateral and implementing agencies are produced annually. <br>The MLF has a number of roles in knowledge production, such as producing fact sheets on demonstration projects. However, there is neither a clear statement on the exact role of the MLF in knowledge production nor evidence on how knowledge products produced by the MLF have been perceived by partners.',

    'value': 'Projects and programmes are largely decentralised and managed in a flexible way. This has the potential advantage to be flexible to context changes, provided of course that these changes are observed and addressed in a timely manner. Generally speaking, the fact that UNCTAD is a non-resident agency does affect its agility, in the sense that where it does not have staff on the ground, it is less able to anticipate or respond in a timely manner to unforeseen events. Besides ensuring that the necessary secretariat-wide mechanisms are in place, agility in TC also depends on the extent to which individual staff members pro-actively manage their portfolio. The Project Review Committee’s Terms of Reference include a monitoring oversight role; in practice, this is hardly the case. Instead, monitoring is largely dealt with at the divisional level. <br>UNCTAD’s TC is expected to be based on its comparative advantage; differentiation of its work with respect to other organisations; and complementarity. Member states see UNCTAD as the key UN agency on its mandated themes and topics. Survey responses show high levels of appreciation for UNCTAD’s staff, skills and products, including TC and knowledge products. This is corroborated by evidence from across the five subprogramme evaluations. Most programmes and projects are demand-driven; others are partly donor-driven, in the sense that earmarked funding criteria determine which countries are eligible for TC support and which ones are not.<br>The very nature of UNCTAD’s work is to put in place or strengthen country systems, in accordance with the common principles listed in the Busan partnership document. There is evidence that diagnosis of country systems is part of the screening process of new requests, and the majority of projects seek to ensure full ownership of member states and transfer capacity to countries.<br>Notwithstanding considerable effort by the OSG to encourage interdivisional collaboration, as a way to leverage expertise and avoid fragmentation, staff perceptions of the level and depth of cross-divisional co-ordination and collaboration vary significantly. This is corroborated by findings in independent external evaluations. With respect to external synergies, as a non-resident agency, partnerships are vitally important. Interviewees point out that the UNCTAD secretariat has been involved in the UN Development System Reform process from the very start. UNCTAD’s leadership of the United Nations Inter-Agency Cluster on Trade and Productive Capacity is a particularly important vehicle, as well as the work undertaken by UNCTAD’s regional presence in Addis Ababa and New York. UNCTAD’s engagement on the UNSDCFs is noteworthy but insufficiently resourced to actually match its ambitions or growing demand.<br>UNCTAD is not a signatory to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI); however, it does provide transparent information about budgets and posts during management briefings with member states. Moreover, the TC Section reports annually to the Trade and Development Board, providing detailed Reviews of TC Activities and Their Financing and associated annexes. There is evidence that joint progress assessments of TC do occur, though not in all cases.<br>Knowledge products are an important part of UNCTAD’s work in general, as well as products of the TC pillar itself. Member states participating in the partner survey show high levels of appreciation for UNCTAD’s knowledge products, with over 90% of respondents stating that they are (very) useful to their work.',

    'value': 'UNIDO’s model of working is explicitly based on collaboration. The flagship PCP programmes are based on engagement with donors, development partners, the national government and private sector in order to bring these together to leverage and co-ordinate funding and technical resources to achieve ISID. UNIDO’s expertise and experience in accessing and combining bilateral and private sector finance for industrial projects, and in convening partnerships, are seen as key comparative advantages. There are concerns with fragmentation in practice, especially in the non-PCP country programmes and with some projects, and examples of silo working and missed opportunities for effective co-operation with other programmes and projects. <br>The PCP approach promises greater support of country systems, although it is not yet a confirmed way forward for UNIDO. PCPs provide great potential in terms of mobilisation of resources. Despite some successes, there has not yet been a major shift with regard to the mobilisation of large-scale public and private investment. There has been noted success in using small amounts of UNIDO seed money to leverage large investments by IFIs and governments. UNIDO has a strength in leveraging access to private funding but does not make this explicit within project design, monitoring and reporting. Use of country systems is not prioritised or monitored, in line with the UNIDO operational model of direct implementation.<br>At country level, there is partnership assessment and agreement of changes by the project or national steering committee of progress for projects/country programmes/PCPs on a regular basis. Interviewees noted that not all project managers engage stakeholders well in mutual assessments and feedback. Planning procedures allow flexibility in adjusting projects; within UNIDO’s project-driven model, there is little scope for programmatic adjustment to reflect learning or changes in context. Both donors and HQ sign-offs to changes have contributed to delays in implementation.<br>UNIDO participates closely in joint planning with the UN, takes part in United Nations Country Team (UNCT) meetings and the UNDAF, and has been active in joint programmes with a large number of UN organisations. There is little engagement with UNCTs in those countries where UNIDO has no/limited presence, reflecting the challenge of constrained capacity. Regional chiefs and URs responsible for cluster or sub-regional offices try to co-ordinate with such countries, but their limited capacity means that their engagement is often relatively minimal, despite good effort and intent. <br>Knowledge sharing and strengthening has become a more explicit priority for UNIDO in its work with partners since 2018. The MTPF 2018-2021 emphasises UNIDO’s plan to increase its focus on analytic and statistical work to better support countries in their efforts towards achieving ISID and the SDGs. UNIDO leads on indicators for SDG 9 and produces the IDR, research papers, reports and standard databases on industrialisation. These products are well regarded, but there is little evidence gathered on partners’ perceptions of their utility and quality.',

    'value': 'UNODC has differentiated planning, extension and approval processes in place for lower- and higher-value revisions to projects. These controls seem robust and appropriate and enable agility within partnerships. They appear to allow changes within a reasonable timeframe. Evaluations have identified bottlenecks in implementation, and UNODC is looking to speed up its processes: however, any changes are too recent to be reflected in this assessment.<br>UNODC’s partnerships are largely based on its comparative advantages in technical knowledge, convening power, policy dialogue and advocacy. UNODC is clear that its areas of competence are a logical consequence of its foundational mandates. Its statement of its comparative advantages could be clearer and more effectively communicated. Its competences, and what it contributes to a partnership, are known and often very highly valued by its government and donor partners. The steady increase in the value of extrabudgetary support is a reflection that donors have confidence in the value of UNODC’s contribution. <br>There is currently no clear overarching statement on how UNODC seeks to deliver on the Busan commitment or the quadrennial comprehensive policy review. That said, in practice, UNODC operations – its technical support and policy development – are with government counterparts and work within, and largely to support, the government capacity and system. <br>UNODC strategies and designs do clearly recognise the importance of synergies and leverage. The Proposed Programme Plan for the Biennium sets expectations of synergies across the subprogrammes. The project design template requires staff to consider “synergies with other programmes and projects” under “Situation Analysis”, and so the issue is considered explicitly at the design stage. Several evaluations indicate that UNODC’s practice of delivering synergies in partnerships could be strengthened.<br>There is evidence that in relation to country and regional interventions UNODC co-ordinates key business practices (planning, design, implementation, monitoring and reporting) with its partners. Country and regional representatives participate in United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs) and monitor its engagement – global and thematic programmes tend not to. UNODC engages in an extremely broad range of joint programmes and initiatives, uses its research and knowledge to capacity to fill strategic gaps and is starting to undertake more joint evaluations. The evidence in relation to global- and thematic-level work is mixed: some are not co-ordinated either internally within UNODC or with relevant local partners. Some are designed without reference to country or regional contexts and local field offices are not consulted when implementation is planned.<br>UNODC does not have a clear corporate statement on the transparency of key programmatic information. Only a shallow level of corporate data is publicly available. UNODC has not yet signed up to the IATI. It is listed as an IATI participant and does not publish its data on the IATI Registry. It is dependent on the UN Secretariat’s implementation of forthcoming enhancements to Umoja to be able to publish data to the IATI Registry. UNODC also does not report its financial outflows to the Creditor Reporting System of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC). <br>While UNODC appears to lack a formal, explicit statement of its standards, its procedures for accountability to beneficiaries (often referred to as target groups) are embedded in its programme document template and accompanying explanatory text. UNODC’s results-based management guidance also stresses the need to demonstrate beneficiary accountability. As a policy, however, it does not appear well-developed.<br>UNODC has a mandate to lead in the assessment of globally-agreed drug and crime conventions. Therefore, participation with partners in assessments of progress in implementing agreed commitments is one of its key functions. There is a great deal of evidence from the different sectors that headquarters-based sectors, regional offices and global programmes lead or participate in multi-stakeholder dialogue at the global, regional and national levels. UNODC is also involved at the country level in mutual assessments in its areas of competence – using its influence to encourage partner governments to improve its performance. It also takes part in UN Country Team planning, monitoring and evaluation.<br>The objective of one of UNODC’s six substantive subprogrammes is to “enhance knowledge” of trends on drugs and crime to support evidence-based policy. UNODC’s Research and Trend Analysis Branch produces several flagship publications periodically, and there is evidence that these are used and valued. Individual programmes also tend to contain a research component. However, a recent evaluation noted that UNODC “has allowed political concerns to take precedence over credible research” and that this has encouraged a “culture of conservatism” that is not in UNODC’s long-term interest. Interviews confirmed that this is an issue of concern internally. UNODC’s Research Branch is more dependent on programme funds than was the case historically: this dependence further undermines its ability to maintain the independence of the topics it focuses on and its findings.',

HQ staff described how there is flexibility over the course of a project to make adjustments as needed, on a tranche-by-tranche basis.<br>The question of whether institutional procedures can be made at a decentralised level within a limited timeframe is considered non-applicable to this assessment, as revisions are tied to the submission and approval of a new tranche request. <br>This process provides regular review points, as each request for a new funding tranche requires a review from the MLF to determine its suitability. HQ staff described this process as a “self-cleaning mechanism”.<br>HQ interviews described how this “self-cleaning mechanism” can identify and act on institutional bottlenecks in procedures, as a lack of progress must be explained and followed up on and funds returned if necessary. Reasons for the delays in the submission of tranches are reported to the Executive Committee. However, the extent to which this process, or the report on tranche submission delays, successfully addresses commonly identified bottlenecks, or the common causes of delays, is not made explicit in documentation reviewed for this assessment.',

On TC, as stated before (MI 3.1), directors are authorised to re-allocate staff capacity across their own divisional priorities. In practice, this is done flexibly without formalising positions for unforeseen or emergent needs, pending decision to formally seek approval of member states. The Project Review Committee’s Terms of Reference include a monitoring oversight role; in practice, this is hardly the case. Instead, monitoring is largely dealt with at the divisional level.<br>At the project level, UNCTAD has adequate mechanisms in place to monitor expenditure on a regular basis (monthly or more often, if required) and take corrective measures if needed. Project budget revisions are subject to the particular case-by-case arrangements with the project’s donor(s); in some cases, these are flexible, in others less so. <br>Generally speaking, the fact that UNCTAD is a non-resident agency does affect its agility, in the sense that where it does not have staff on the ground, it is less able to anticipate or respond in a timely manner to unforeseen events. In practice, responses have proven to be very project specific. On the one hand, we saw evidence of project officers and project managers having developed highly effective, project-specific mechanisms to track progress, on a daily basis even, allowing them to take corrective measures if and when necessary. In another case, the project officer and manager were much less informed about progress and contextual dynamics, instead relying on the regional office in Addis Ababa to address some of the implementation challenges in a reactive manner. Thus, aside from ensuring that the necessary secretariat-wide mechanisms are in place, agility in TC also depends on the extent to which individual staff members pro-actively manage their portfolio.

The MTPF 2018-21 also introduces a new objective to strengthen knowledge and institutions, although this focuses more on capacity building and support than use of country systems. GEF projects are clearly based in country systems, since the Operational Strategy of the GEF emphasises country ownership and stakeholder involvement as fundamental operational principles. PCPs are led by the host government and focus on selected priority sectors and areas essential to the country’s industrial development agenda. Overall the approach to using country systems is not consistent or clear.<br>The extent to which there is a clear diagnostic for the strength of country systems is not clear (see KPI 5.2). Country programmes reviewed identify sectors and institutions for investment. These assessments are developed with country partners and agreed by them through the government sign-off of country projects and projects. The Morocco PCP is piloting partner mapping as part of pre-PCP analysis to position the PCP more robustly within country systems and institutions. The Technical Cooperation Guidelines emphasise country ownership but do not explicitly provide guidance or direction on use of country systems.<br>There is now a greater focus on responding to country systems through the flagship PCP approach which is based on co-ordination of UNIDO activities and investments with the government and partners. The MTPF 2018-21 period sees a shift being made by UNIDO from its focus on individual project implementation to a focus on scale-up and integration. This shift is intended to achieve a more strategic and long-term approach to strengthen country industrialisation policies, institutions and infrastructure. There remains, even in PCPs, a strong focus on individual projects. Partner survey responses judging the extent to which “UNIDO takes action to build capacity in country systems in Country X where it has judged that country systems are no yet up to a required standard” were relatively negative. <br>Currently UNIDO does not use country systems. The organisation is now considering ways to increase use of project implementation entities (PEEs) and to develop their capacity where required. A pilot programme in China uses a national partner to work in UNIDO systems; large subcontracts are let with waivers on competitive bidding and are therefore comparable to national implementation. This builds on the experience in China of Montreal Protocol projects being implemented by subcontracted firms. UNIDO provides an oversight role only. This is a change in role for UNIDO, and interviewees noted it requires a culture shift away from direct implementation for project managers. <br>No evidence was seen on UNIDO’s monitoring of investment in country systems or of their use. The 2019 mid-term review of the MTPF 2018-21 and related IRPF has introduced new indicators using a behavioural change model. The 2019 revised theory of change for UNIDO includes outcome indicators for strengthening knowledge and institutions which include business practices, technology, policies and standards, knowledge and capacities, investments, and partnerships.',

    'value': 'There is currently no clear overarching statement on how UNODC seeks to deliver on the Busan commitment or the quadrennial comprehensive policy review. That said, in practice, UNODC operations – its technical support and policy development – is with government counterparts, and it works within, and largely to support, the government capacity and system. It does not appear to develop parallel systems. UNODC aligns its programmes with national governments, which are often themselves delivery/implementation partners. UNODC participates with collective UN efforts to enhance coherence and efficiency at the country level by, among other things, aligning its planning and programming within UNDAFs – and has recently committed additional resources to enable it to do this in high priority contexts.<br>At least three regional programmes make explicit reference to working within the Busan principles: for example, the Somalia Rule of Law and Human Security regional programme is clear that it is working within the Somali Compact and the UN Integrated Strategic Framework which are designed around principles for engagement between the Somali government and the international community, as defined in the Busan “New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States”. Similarly, the regional programme for West Africa “reflects UNODC’s Integrated Programming Approach (IPA), which aims to improve effectiveness of interventions and incorporate the principles of the Busan [commitments] into UNODC programming”. <br>UNODC’s intervention design template requires staff to diagnose the condition of country systems in the sense that they must analyse government capacity. The “problem analysis” section of intervention designs generally identifies weaknesses in country systems in the specialist area the intervention addresses. <br>UNODC does not stipulate the use of government systems. Given that many UNODC interventions require it to invest in the capacity of several different entities/agencies on a thematic issue, the Office builds specialist capability as opposed to building core state competences (i.e. engaging in public sector reform). <br>The Programme and Operations Manual states that the design of a regional programme should be undertaken in a partnership between UNODC experts, both at headquarters and in the field, and with the countries in the region. As noted, while regional and national programmes are better aligned to national and transnational needs, some global and thematic programmes have a weaker record of doing this.<br>In line with the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) UNDAF guidance, which UNODC subscribes to as a member of the UNDG, and in line with the UN commitment to national ownership through strengthening national capacities, UN activity in a country aims at maximising the use of national systems, including for monitoring and evaluation (M&E). In mid-2018, UNODC invested more resources to enable it to have a presence in additional strategically important countries and engage in adapting and contributing to UN reform efforts. <br>No documentary evidence on incentives or disincentives for responsible officers to use country systems was found. However, UNODC staff will be subject to the same incentives as other UN Country Team members. <br>Where a programme output is to build the capacity of a specialist entity, UNODC’s semi-annual and annual reporting should capture how effective these investments are.',

However, one of the key concepts of the Multilateral Fund is that it provides financing for the incremental costs of the phase-out of substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol. This is, by definition, leveraging the use of resources. The work of IAs is co-ordinated by the MLF to ensure co-operation in delivering the requirements of the Protocol – there is no evidence of fragmentation. An interview with the UNDP Montreal Protocol unit described the twice-yearly inter-agency co-operation meetings, held before Executive Committee meetings, and the incentives and mechanisms for sharing information and co-operating with other IAs.<br>All other elements of this MI are considered non-applicable in the context of this assessment.

    'value': 'This MI is interpreted in terms of internal synergies, with MI 6.5 and 6.6. assessing external synergies and business practices.<br>As described above in MI 1.2, secretariat-wide, cross-divisional collaboration and co-ordination has been a recurrent theme for UNCTAD.<br>UNCTAD recognises that interdivisional co-operation, which builds on the strength and expertise of different divisions, is important for the effective delivery of TC activities. Recently, the secretariat has embarked on an organisation-wide effort to move from a division-based approach to management to a horizontal, task-based approach, notably by creating cross-divisional working groups on statistical co-ordination, gender, financing for development and South-South co-operation. In its 2018 Annual Report, the secretariat reported on a number of cross-divisional initiatives in different areas. There are now interdivisional working groups such as statistics and gender. Another example is the Train for Trade II project in Angola.<br>Through the Office of the Secretary-General and the TC Section, the secretariat is making efforts to move to a more horizontal, task-based approach to leverage resources and knowledge. Various initiatives, including biannual management retreats and the Chiefs meetings chaired by the OSG Chief of Staff, town hall meetings and others, are undertaken in a step-by-step fashion. On TC <br>particularly, we did not find evidence of a structural, secretariat-wide and systematic approach to cross-divisional collaboration at directors level, similar to, for example, the research and analysis pillar. In practice, in TC, the level of co-operation between sections, branches and divisions varies from project to project. It is undertaken mostly at an operational project/programme level, with different sections and branches contributing to each other’s interventions. The UN Development Account projects, on the other hand, which account for less than 9% of the overall TC expenditures, are deliberately designed and selected to strengthen inter-divisional collaboration.<br>Evidence from staff interviews shows there are considerably diverging views within the secretariat about the level and depth of cross-divisional co-ordination and collaboration, as a way to leverage expertise and avoid fragmentation. It would appear that the extent to which synergies are achieved depends largely on the people in charge of the project and how effectively they mobilise others. Much depends on the staff’s own professional networks, experience and preferences.<br>External evaluations also point out that “there remains scope to strengthen synergistic efforts, including through interdivisional and external collaboration”. The synthesis findings of the five subprogramme evaluations states that the evaluations observed that limited collaboration, for example on research outputs, affected the resonance of UNCTAD messaging and suggested that there is merit in building a culture of coherent messaging and collaborative functioning across divisions.<br>On internal collaborations, substantive responsibility for a subprogramme is largely vested in one of the divisions of UNCTAD but achieving the objective of each subprogramme is an organisational responsibility. Nonetheless, all evaluations noted that divisions work fairly independently, within an “institutional culture of siloed functioning” (subprogramme 3). As a consequence, “synergies are not systematically exploited” (subprogramme 1), there appears to be discordant messaging (subprogramme 3), there is evidence of “avoidable duplication” (subprogramme 5) and follow-up support following conclusion of a project that could be provided by another part of UNCTAD is limited (subprogramme 2).” Similarly, remarks made by representatives of some regional groups, “encouraging the secretariat to further strengthen interdivisional and inter-agency co-operation for increased coherence and impact and the sharing of best practices when delivering technical assistance, taking into account the mandate of UNCTAD and the outcome of its internal task forces”, suggest that performance in this area is not yet satisfactory.<br>We did not find evidence of a clear statement of how resources will be used catalytically to stimulate wider change (see also KPI 12 on sustainability of results).',

    'value': 'UNIDO’s model of working is explicitly based on collaboration in the MTPF 2018-21 and in the Strategy for Industrial Development Partnerships 2018-21. A key outcome in the 2019 revised IRPF is “reach and reaction” to the “whole spectrum of actors relevant to a country’s industrialisation”. PCP programmes are explicitly based on engagement with different donors, development partners, the national government and private sector, with the intent to bring these together to leverage and co-ordinate funding and technical resources to achieve ISID. Collaboration with other entities of the United Nations Country Team under the United Nations Development Assistance Framework is stated to be fundamental to UNIDO’s working within the MTPF 2018-21 and UNIDO Strategy for Industrial Development Partnerships 2018-21. The partner survey responses showed a very positive view of UNIDO’s working in synergy, although a lower level of satisfaction with the coherence of financial  cooperation.<br>Country programmes do not explicitly set out how duplication will be avoided. In contrast, the six pilot PCPs are explicitly intended to bring together complementary interventions and projects aligned with national objectives, using UNIDO’s expertise and leveraging additional finance from partners. In PCPs, a joint funding programme is developed with government and partners in which each partner, including UNIDO, plays to its strengths. For instance, the Ethiopia PCP focuses on three light industry sectors, because of factors including their potential for generating jobs and attracting private sector investment, and also because they can use UNIDO’s specific expertise in these sectors. <br>Project designs are in recent years more explicitly designed to contribute to wider changes in industrialisation and are more strategically placed in relation to national and partner plans. There is an explicit commitment to scale up. For instance, a Montreal Protocol project on replacing refrigerators is designed to be complementary to existing operations and projects in the country and to provide a low-cost, high-impact intervention with a potential for scale-up. Country programmes and project proposals do sometimes state that there will be wider change or scale-up as a result of the intervention, but the detail on how this will be achieved is not clearly given. <br>In some PCPs, such as Morocco and Senegal, there has been noted success in using small amounts of UNIDO seed money to leverage large investments by IFIs and governments. PCPs provide great potential in terms of co-ordination; however, mobilisation of resources can take time, and despite some successes, there has not yet been a major shift with regard to the mobilisation of large-scale public and private investment. The synthesis of evaluations 2015-18 found that project co-financing had been higher than anticipated albeit not clearly monitored and tracked by UNIDO. Designs do not consistently address how/if leverage will be ensured.<br>There are concerns with fragmentation in practice, especially in the non-PCP country programmes. A country programme evaluation found that more effort was required to develop country systems and partnerships to create links and share resources across projects and the country programme. Another found that “the potential for linkages [between supported projects] was not exploited nor pursued with diligent intentionality neither was it attained between them”. The 2016 synthesis of evaluations found that “insufficient attention was paid to internal/external synergies” and that there were examples of silo working and missed opportunities for effective co-operation with other programmes and projects. Partners who identified themselves as a peer organisation were more likely to assign less positive ratings to the partner survey question “UNIDO co-operates with development or humanitarian partners to make sure that financial co-operation in Country X is coherent and not fragmented”.',

    'value': 'UNODC strategies and designs do recognise the importance of synergies and leverage. The Proposed Programme Plan for the Biennium sets expectations of synergies across the subprogrammes. However, because such a high proportion of subprogramme interventions reflect donor priorities over strategic priorities identified by UNODC’s own analysis, it is hard for UNODC to deliver cross-subprogramme synergies in practice. The project design template does require staff to consider “synergies with other programmes and projects” under “Situation Analysis”, and in principle it should be considered explicitly at the design stage. The project document for the Global Programme on Cybercrime is a good example of the treatment of synergies. UNODC works with member states and counterparts among other stakeholder groups. Some evaluations report that partnerships with national counterparts are strong and synergistic.<br>Country and regional programmes tend to be grounded in a strong understanding of the local context – which includes what other stakeholders are doing. These interventions do avoid duplication and fragmentation. However, as indicated, several interviewees noted that global <br>programmes are sometimes imposed on country contexts with inadequate attention to existing processes, resulting in duplication and fragmentation. There are weak controls that prevent this from happening, and the institution-wide incentive to secure donor funding is a driver for its persistence. Some evaluations also indicate that UNODC’s practice of delivering synergies in partnerships could be strengthened – pointing to a lack of co-ordination in country, and to competition for resources, which limits potential internal synergies. <br>Project designs require a clear statement setting out the justification for UNODC’s involvement. These tend to review UNODC’s mandate in the context of the programme challenge and the specific conditions and the specific gap. In view of UNODC’s specialist mandate, there is very little potential for duplication. <br>Strategies and programme design documents do tend to contain a clear statement of where an intervention will add value to wider change. This information is contained in the mandatory analysis of the problem, in the situation analysis in each project document and in the outcome indicators of programme logframes.<br>No documentary evidence was found in strategies or designs giving a clear statement of how leverage is ensured.<br>Strategies and designs do tend to contain a statement of how resources will be used catalytically to stimulate wider change.',

    'value': 'The majority of CRPs and their projects carry out very extensive consultation and co-ordination exercises as part of their planning. Evidence from the interviews confirms the range of co-ordination with other Research Centers and with partners in the development of programmes and interventions. All the POWBs prepared annually are carried out jointly with partners, to ensure alignment. <br>The 2018 POWBs for all the sample CRPs additionally provide a table with a brief description of collaborations among programmes and between the programmes and platforms. The description of collaboration illustrates the “give and take” among CRPs and the value added. <br>The 2017 Performance Report includes a focus on evidence that the CRPs participate in joint programming, setting out a range of examples: “Overall, only 14% of innovations were tagged as being the ‘sole’ product of CGIAR and of these, nearly two thirds (61%) were at the first stage of <br>innovation (discovery/proof of concept). At the development/scaling stage, 94% of innovations were the product of joint work: in 73% of cases the CRP was the ‘lead Organisation’ in a partnership, while in 21% of cases, the CRP was a ‘contributor’ to a team led by partners. This includes participation in joint monitoring and reporting.”<br>The ISPC has held regular Science Forums that have focused on joint identification of the global state of information and gaps in different key areas of CGIAR work. In addition, the objective of many of the CRP/Flagship consultation exercises is to jointly identify key information gaps. The Standing Panel on Impact Assessment (SPIA) also worked with the World Bank to incorporate CGIAR data into the Living Standards Measurement Survey, to include Integrated Surveys of Agriculture in eight sub-Saharan African countries as a means of tracking the uptake of and adoption of improved varieties.',

    'value': 'As noted above, this review considers partnership working as the co-operation between IAs and national authorities. Joint working with other organisations is an intrinsic part of how the Montreal Protocol is delivered. The Executive Committee Primer (2018) describes how “bilateral cooperation encompasses the full range of projects and activities funded under the Multilateral Fund. Project proposals from bilateral agencies are submitted by the donor country and are usually presented in a single bilateral cooperation document together with the Secretariat’s reviews of and recommendations on these project proposals”. Working with the IAs is central to how the Montreal Protocol is delivered. The mandate of the IAs is to “(a) be requested by the Committee, in the context of country programmes to facilitate compliance with the Protocol, to co-operate with and assist the Parties within their respective areas of expertise; and (b) to develop an inter-agency agreement and specific agreements with the Committee acting on behalf of the Parties” (MLF, 2017, Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria – Implementing Agencies). Each IA prepares an annual work programme for their delivery on Montreal Protocol activities (MLF, 2018, Report of the 81st Meeting of the Executive Committee). The MLF management document, The Multilateral Fund: Governance, Business Model, Accomplishments (2019) provides a useful summary of the role of the IAs. The document review also suggests that the IAs each have a more strategic role, based on their expertise. Recent MOPAN reports are available on the four IAs.<br>All monitoring and reporting processes under the Montreal Protocol are a joint effort between NOUs, IAs and the MLF.<br>Co-ordination between governments and implementing agencies is provided by regional network meetings (MLF, 2017, Policies, Procedures, Guidelines and Criteria. 9. Project Proposals). In 2018, the report of the 82nd meeting of the Executive Committee (2018) noted that “one member expressed continued concern at the irregular attendance of representatives of the Secretariat at the regional network meetings”. The main reason reported was that Secretariat staff were engaged in project review while the network meetings were taking place. The Secretariat always attempted to attend the meetings, if only remotely.<br>HQ staff interviews described how shared information gaps between the bodies of the Montreal Protocol, IAs and national authorities are discussed at the twice-annual meetings of the Executive Committee, at Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, and at other meetings/workshops with IAs and NOUs. Any actions taken to address such gaps are detailed in the reports which are released after each meeting. For example, the Report of the 82nd Meeting of the Executive Committee (2018) states that “one member pointed out that paragraphs 1, 2 and 7 of decision XXX/5 would require consideration in the context of discussions on energy efficiency and would need to be taken up appropriately during consultations. The Secretariat might be requested to undertake additional work on some of the elements”.<br>No evidence was found of MLF participation in joint planning, management and delivery of evaluation activities. According to the Secretariat, topics and terms of reference for evaluations are discussed with the Secretariat and IAs, and planning is done with the IAs and NOUs.',

    'value': 'As a non-resident agency, partnerships are vitally important. Interviewees point out that the UNCTAD secretariat has been involved in the UN Development System Reform process from the very start and at all levels, including the OSG, the TCS and the New York office. It has actively participated in a number of work streams. For instance, UNCTAD currently contributes to 37 UNDAFs/UNSDCFs through its leadership of the United Nations Inter-Agency Cluster on Trade and Productive Capacity, composed of 15 agencies of the United Nations development system. Led by UNCTAD, the Cluster is developing joint operations with the following agencies: FAO, ITC, ILO, UNDP, UNEP, UNIDO, UNOPS, WTO and the five UN Regional Commissions. The Cluster has been instrumental in increasing the UNCTAD footprint in United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks and co-ordinating with other agencies at the country level. It should be noted that there is no budget or secretariat available to run the Cluster.<br>UNCTAD reports that, since 2016, it has deepened its engagement with United Nations development system entities, including the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Sustainable Development Group and the regional commissions. It has also strengthened its participation in the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, the Forum on Financing for Development, the Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Development, the high-level political forum on sustainable development, the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the regional forums on sustainable development.<br>The opening of a regional presence in Addis Ababa, along with the advocacy and engagement undertaken by the New York office, have made a positive contribution to UNCTAD’s positioning vis-à-vis other agencies within and outside the UN. Interviewees emphasise that much more will be needed in order to better position UNCTAD towards other UN agencies and non-UN stakeholders and leverage its expertise. In terms of UNCTAD’s engagement on the UNSDCFs, it should be noted that the in-house capacity involved (one full-time equivalent) is very limited and that the work itself is not mainstreamed within divisions. Despite the limited resources, UNCTAD does carry out joint monitoring in some cases. However, demand far exceeds available capacity; in order to meet its own objectives in this regard, more capacity within the OSG and secretariat-wide engagement of staff will be necessary.<br>External evaluations recognise UNCTAD’s efforts in this regard. For example, the evaluation of subprogramme 5 stated that “UNCTAD was disadvantaged by not having ears to the ground, networks, relationships and consultations. UNCTAD in general, and ALDC in particular, had undertaken a number of steps to promote collaboration and partnerships, yet much remains to be done, including developing an overarching road map of partnerships at the institutional level. There is also a need to increase incentives for staff to actively seek collaboration…with other United Nations entities. In line with ongoing United Nations reform efforts, an effort should be made to increase the presence of UNCTAD on United Nations country teams in all countries in which UNCTAD carries out substantial work.”<br>The same evaluation observed overlap between UNCTAD’s subprogramme 5 and the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, which supports the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action and covers much of the same substantive areas as subprogramme 5. The two organisational units are of approximately the same size. UNCTAD has technical capacity yet lacks a significant presence in New York, necessary for greater policy impacts; the Office of the High Representative has such a presence yet lacks technical capacity.<br>Regarding evidence of participation in the joint planning, management and delivery of evaluation activities, all four UNDAF/UNSDCF projects that were analysed as part of the project portfolio sample, include evidence of contribution to a joint report but not of collaboration in the reporting process. A number of other projects describe co-ordination measures with other agencies (both UN and complementary donor agency projects) to deliver the project.',

    'value': 'UNIDO participates closely in joint planning with the UN. UNIDO guidance requires that the formulation of programmes and projects is shaped by the need for consistency with UN programming principles and UNIDO’s goal of ISID. Typically the UNIDO area of focus is on environmental governance and strengthening productive sectors to promote inclusive growth and local development. There is little engagement with UNCTs in those countries where UNIDO has no/limited presence (although UNIDO works with 156 countries, it has only 38 field offices). Regional chiefs and URs responsible for cluster or sub-regional offices try to co-ordinate with such countries, but their limited capacity means that their engagement is often relatively minimal, despite good effort and intent. Nonetheless, with the UN Development System reforms, the organisation seeks to engage more actively in the UN Sustainable Development Framework and to retain its place within the UNCT in anticipation of future changes within country teams.<br>URs/UCRs are active members of the UNCT in developing UNDAFs, in countries where UNIDO has representation. UNIDO country programmes and PCPs reviewed show alignment between the government, UNDAF, SDG and UNIDO ISID objectives. The partner survey found relatively negative views of UNIDO’s alignment of its planning and reporting activities with partners; donors had especially negative views. Discussions are taking place at different levels within UNIDO on the opportunities for UNIDO’s role in the UNCT in future, which is not at present clear. URs/UCRs, HQ staff and evaluations note that the extent of effective engagement in the UNDAF and UNCT is closely related to the effectiveness of the individual UR/UCR’s proactive leadership skills.<br>Joint programmes have been implemented with a range of UN entities, including ILO and UNCTAD on youth employment; the Food and Agriculture Organization, ILO and the United Nations Development Programme in agro-industrial value chains upgrading programmes; UNEP in environment and energy programmes; as well as UN Women, the International Organization for Migration, UN Habitat and the World Food Programme. These joint programmes have enabled relatively small UNIDO projects to have greater scope and impact through collaboration. Where OneUN or Delivering as One arrangements are in place, these have permitted UNIDO to mobilise additional financial resources. Although these are sometimes small funds, they are significant for UNIDO. An IDDA3 (Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa) joint road map has been developed with several other UN agencies, including regional economic commissions, to facilitate joint programmes and reduce UN fragmentation in Africa. There is a UNIDO collaboration with six UN entities that make joint diagnostic trade assessments which is a USD 200 million operation.<br>Country programmes have country programme steering committees with a membership of country government departments and institutions, including relevant UN entities and donors, to which progress is reported and which has a monitoring and co-ordination function. Country programmes typically have a biannual reporting process to a national steering group/committee. Different donors are responsible for co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation of their own projects, which are then brought together for reporting and review purposes. A monitoring and evaluation system for measuring progress and programme level impact is jointly agreed with the national steering committee. In PCPs, the role of UNIDO is explicitly focused on monitoring and reporting outcomes, results and progress for the PCP. <br>No evidence of information gap analysis was seen in country programmes, context analyses or country programmes.<br>When required, the Independent Evaluation Division is also involved in joint evaluations, for example with sister UN agencies or donors, where the Independent Evaluation Division (IED) provides support. However, few have been undertaken recently.',

    'value': 'Mechanisms are in place to allow project changes, using a process which requires consultation and agreement with national partners and which is subject to donor agreement. Such changes include revisions to scope, with appropriately adjusted outcomes and outputs as well as project extensions. A mechanism for allowing budget revisions to be made (with specified thresholds and with escalated approval processes depending on the threshold) is also in place. Approvals are made within UNIDO, with the exception of budget extensions for the GEF, which must be endorsed by the GEF Coordinator. No reference is made to timeframes for changes in guidelines. An issue identified by staff and partners (in the partner survey) is that there can be delays in making changes in a timely way. <br>These processes for adjustment are used for individual projects; within UNIDO’s project-driven model, there is no scope for programmatic adjustment to reflect learning or changes in context. The project-based work model limits UNIDO’s flexibility to significantly redirect funding when/if needed, unless donors agree it. The process required can in principle be completed within three months. The partner survey reports a relatively high proportion of negative views for the question “UNIDO’s flexibility in its financial resources enable it to meet the needs it targets in Country X”, indicating lack of satisfaction with UNIDO’s flexibility. Partners from one country noted that “uncertainty in UNIDO’s resource allocation caused disruptions in local planning” and that “funding procedures should be more flexible and the local arm of UNIDO should be strengthened on strategic issues as lack of decision-making at the local level is causing implementation delays”. <br>Projects are in principle reviewed regularly (every six months) with project steering committees, when potential adjustments can be considered with partners; there is also regular reporting to donors, allowing opportunities to review and adjust. A weakness has been that projects (managed from HQ) are out of touch with countries, and in some cases steering committees have not met consistently. Since 2018, monthly virtual meetings between the field offices with the regional chief, project managers and divisional leads at HQ enable regular review of new challenges and issues at country level and within projects to identify any potential changes required. <br>Several evaluations noted that there have been experiences of delay caused when HQ has been required to sign off changes, although the reasons are not given. Donors can also contribute to delays when they delay agreement, a factor that was reported in interviews and also noted in evaluations. Project closure and final payments from donors are also sometimes delayed, especially when project results are required to trigger payment. The Finance and Evaluation offices are collaboratively tackling this last problem by de-linking the evaluation from the project both procedurally and financially. Planned actions to tackle other delays to changes are not identified.',

Headquarters (global programmes) project revisions, are submitted by programme managers and approved either by the Division Director or the Executive Director. In terms of timeframe, once the project revisions are finalised and submitted by offices for clearance by finance and human resource management sections, direct approval is intended to take one week, and review by the Programme Review Committee and Executive Director is intended to take approximately three weeks. The review team saw examples of this in practice. Profi was due to be replaced by the UN Secretariat’s introduction of UE2 in December 2019 and, at the time of the assessment, UNODC was not informed if it would give the level of functionality they required. Due to delays in the deployment of UE2, Profi will be in place for a longer period.<br>Guidance given to programme managers requires the involvement of partners in regular review points. Annual progress reports are supposed to be discussed with all stakeholders through a Tripartite Review Meeting before being finalised. Any proposed changes in the results frameworks should also be highlighted with partners, and agreement should be reached. The team was presented with minutes of review meetings that reflected the joint identification and interpretation of changes in conditions. <br>There is evidence in evaluations, audits and other internal documentation of slow contracting/procurement by the Division for Management. These documents note that posts remained unfilled and that there were delays to implementation in the field. The team also reviewed evidence that action was taken to reduce these bottlenecks. As noted in earlier micro-indicators, procurement and delegated authority in UNODC is changing, in response to a UN Secretariat directive. It is too early to identify impact. <br>The Audit of the UNODC Framework for Engagement of External Parties recommended that the Division for Management should “establish expected timelines for key segments of the process for selection of non-commercial vendors, implementing partners and grants and develop a monitoring tool to track the timelines and report delays”. UNODC notes that it has now established a tracking and reporting tool that will be rolled out in late 2019 and that it is seeking input from stakeholders to identify ways to speed up implementation. <br>More broadly, the UN Secretariat is likely to introduce new policies and procedures intended to result in streamlined systems for UNODC in 2020: the General Assembly will announce its decision on Secretariat proposals on a new global service delivery model in March/April 2020.',

    'value': 'The three-year business plan clearly sets out that “CGIAR’s role is to use its unique partnerships and interfacing roles as well as the diversity of assets and skills to meet the SDGs. The scale and breadth of the task places CGIAR in a unique role – since the diversity and depth of its assets, activities and focus, range of partnerships and history of delivering impact at scale place it in a unique position to help lead this change.” <br>The Evaluation of Partnerships in CGIAR includes the conclusion that “CGIAR’s comparative advantage lies in a combination of two factors: presence in and knowledge of the many countries where it works, in some cases with long-term links to national institutions, and a reputation as a solid scientific partner – a world leader in some areas.” In response to this conclusion, there are efforts to build on these strengths through the performance-based management system, which is currently under development and which focuses in part on partnerships.<br>The CRP proposals were formulated with significant levels of stakeholder and partner inputs. The CRP proposals include sections on the Roles of CGIAR Research Centers and Integration with other CGIAR Research Programs and Partnership strategy. These set out respectively: the comparative<br>advantages of Research Centers within CRPs and the contributions that will be made to other CRPs; and the processes by which CGIAR will work with partners to define what each brings to the partnership and the resources that will be required. The POWBs have a section on planned major collaborations, which includes space to describe the collaboration and to set out the value added for the CRP.<br>The CRP proposals include sections on the Partnership strategy, which sets out groups or categories of partners and outlines what partners can bring to the programme. All the CRP proposals reviewed include clear examples setting out the roles that different partner groups will play in implementation.

    'value': 'This MI considers the four IAs as “internal partners”. The MLF’s Executive Committee Primer (2018) provides some (limited) commentary on the roles of the four IAs (UNDP, UNEP, UNIDO and the World Bank): “Broadly speaking, UNDP, UNIDO and the World Bank are responsible for the preparations and implementation of investment projects. The main thrust of UNEP’s activities is on information dissemination, capacity-building, institutional strengthening, networking, and assistance to low-volume-consuming (LVC) Article 5 countries. However, since 2011, UNEP is also involved in the preparation and implementation of investment projects”. <br>HQ interviews, as well as interviews with the UNDP and World Bank Montreal Protocol teams, described how IAs do slightly different kinds of projects, but in practice all IAs are expected to be able to “do the same thing” under the Montreal Protocol. Countries are free to select any IA they wish to work with, and interviewees described the process of a country selecting which IA to work with on a given project as “ad hoc” and influenced by factors such as IA presence in country and the country’s prior relationship with a particular IA. <br>The question of whether the organisation aligns its resources/competencies to its perceived comparative advantage is considered non-applicable to this assessment. This is because the MLF has a singular mandate to act as a financial mechanism for the Montreal Protocol. <br>The Secretariat affirmed that external partnerships between IAs and others are part of the day-to-day work funded under the MLF. These partnerships are generally at the local level and take advantage of comparative advantages at that scale/ level, even if this is not clearly and explicitly documented.',

This is corroborated by evidence from across the five subprogramme evaluations, which found that UNCTAD programmes of work under each subprogramme was well aligned to the secretariat’s mandates and that there was evidence that UNCTAD products meet the needs of its target constituents, some better than others. The relevance of technical assistance interventions in particular was rated highly.<br>A good example of a project’s comparative advantage and pro-active collaboration was visible in the eTrade for All project, where UNCTAD has played a key role in bringing together approximately 30 agencies in a market platform. It allows requesters to see which partner is the most relevant for them, encourages transparency between the agencies about their areas of specialisation and areas of alignment, and reduces duplication. UNCTAD serves as the co-ordinator of the eTrade for All initiative though does not brand it as an UNCTAD product.<br>Most programmes and projects are demand-driven and illustrate how member states regard UNCTAD’s relative capabilities. Others are partly donor-driven, in the sense that earmarked funding criteria determine which countries are eligible for TC support and which ones are not. Based on the analysis of a sample of projects in the partner survey countries, we noted that a comparative advantage was more likely to be stated explicitly when a donor demanded one to justify UNCTAD’s value.',

    'value': 'The MPTF 2018-21 states the importance of UNIDO’s convening power in relation to partnerships, through convening multi-stakeholder partnerships and through leveraging finance and knowledge sharing, based on its technical and sector expertise to help realise ISID. UNIDO describes the PCP as a programme to support a country in achieving ISID goals, designed to deliver an integrated service package by combining UNIDO’s advisory and normative services, technical assistance, and convening function to unlock public and private investment. <br>Country programmes and project documentation refer to drawing on the experiences and expertise of UNIDO in poverty reduction activities, trade capacity building, and environment and energy. UNIDO’s expertise and experience in designing and implementing technical industrial projects in different contexts, in accessing and combining bilateral and private sector finance for industrial projects, and in convening partnerships are seen as its key comparative advantages. Country programme evaluations find that UNIDO is recognised, valued and sought after because of its technical expertise in industrial development as well as its access to the private sector that other entities do not have. The organisation’s knowledge of the country and region, combined with its specialised mandate and expertise, are seen to constitute its comparative advantage in the country. UNIDO brings its experience and convening power to countries through involving the private sector at global levels, accessing funding and, through its network of Investment and Technology Promotion Offices, promoting investment and technology transfer. It partners with sectoral associations and chambers of commerce in donor countries. It also works in partnership with local business sector actors, such as micro, small and medium-sized enterprises or farmers’ associations, throughout its technical co-operation projects. UNIDO has a further advantage in that it is relatively small and agile and has implementation experience.<br>There is a lack of clarity on UNIDO’s overall role within the organisation. Within the staff group, there were different views expressed. One was that the purpose of UNIDO is to support development for industrialisation – to support improved industrialisation as an end in itself. Another view is that UNIDO supports industrialisation for development – to increase industrialisation to build wealth and tax take so that countries are self-sustaining. <br>UNIDO builds on its expertise and convening role in knowledge exchange, using its technical and research knowledge and global, regional and country networks. UNIDO brings member states, financial institutions, the business sector, civil society and other actors together through global and regional fora to exchange knowledge and disseminate information. <br>Since UNIDO’s resources are constrained, its interventions are focused on maximising impact with low-cost interventions. For instance, the UNIDO strategy for Latin America and the Caribbean (a region with little UNIDO-related donor investment) focuses on co-operation, so that UNIDO has a role in convening, co-ordinating and providing expertise and policy dialogue to assist development of industrialisation policies. In Cambodia, UNIDO brought in two experts to a workshop on economic zones which helped gain Ministry of Finance funding and support for the policy and decision to become a PCP; UNIDO’s access to knowledge and networks was seen to add value.<br>UNIDO’s new, more strategic approach to country and partnership working is intended to increase its role in advocacy and policy dialogue with governments and partners. This will require URs/UCRs, historically recruited for technical expertise, to have strong relationship building, political and communication skillsets, as well as expertise in policy development. Not all URs and UCRs have the necessary competencies to meet expectations. Interviews reported that relevant training is being developed.',

    'value': 'UNODC’s partnerships are largely based on its comparative advantages in technical knowledge, convening power, and policy dialogue and advocacy. UNODC is clear that its areas of competence are a logical consequence of its foundational mandates. Its statement of its comparative advantages could, however, be clearer and more effectively communicated. Its competences, and what it contributes to a partnership, are known and often very highly valued by its government and donor partners. The steady increase in the value of extrabudgetary support is a reflection that donors have confidence in the value of UNODC’s contribution. <br>Some programme evaluations, such as the mid-term cluster evaluation of the global trafficking and global programme against smuggling of migrants, have pointed out that UNODC could enhance its impact by defining its contribution and comparative advantage in partnerships more explicitly. Its competences, and what it contributes to a partnership, are known and valued by its partners. The value and contribution UNODC makes to partnerships are evident in UNODC documentation – in its strategic documents, sector plans, and country and programme documents. <br>Some documentation discusses an implicit understanding of comparative advantage. UNODC states that it works collaboratively with other entities based on its “specific mandates and experience in mobilizing transnational cooperation”. It notes it works with other stakeholders, member states and United Nations sister agencies at the country, regional and global levels “to help Member States better understand the nature of the threats they face, as well as to design coherent programmes and policies to address those threats in the context of the targets under Goal 16” that pertain to the mandates of UNODC. <br>Several evaluations highlight UNODC’s comparative advantage while others have stated that it could be more explicit on what they comprise. Its partnership agreements, for example with UN-Habitat, are clear on UNODC’s contribution, and several UNDAFs also recognise UNODC’s contribution. The matrix of UNODC-INTERPOL joint activities in priority areas sets out areas of co-operation, objectives, and specific outcomes and outputs. Similarly, there is a joint work plan for UNODC and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with detailed areas of work across seven subprogrammes. The UNODC and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) joint action plan has been in place since 2013 and includes a statement of comparative advantage. <br>UNODC does align its resources and competencies to its perceived comparative advantage. Most of its activities are funded by donors specifically for its specialist skills: it is thus funded to implement activities in its field of competence. UNODC’s partners highly respect the specialist skills and experience of UNODC’s staff. Of survey respondents, 21% considered the skills and experience of staff “excellent”, and a further 48% considered them “very good”. <br>There is extensive evidence that UNODC’s comparative advantage is deployed in partnerships to positive effect. UNODC has specialised competences, and their contribution is clear from all its programme documentation. The clearest examples are of programmes that partner governments fund UNODC to implement in their own countries, such as its programme in Colombia.',

    'value': 'There is extensive evidence that UNODC has participated in a collaborative planning exercise for joint programmes. Its field and regional offices also have a track record of engaging in UNDAFs: UNODC has tracked its participation and contribution to UNDAFs in an extremely comprehensive – and impressive – way: it has compiled a spreadsheet that follows not just its participation but its financial and substantive contribution. However, while there is evidence that country and regional interventions are well co-ordinated with other relevant partners, global and regional programmes can be designed without adequate attention to the work of others (or of other UNODC interventions). <br>UNODC reports that it made contributions to all relevant outcomes in 14 country UNDAFs and made partial contributions to UNDAF outcomes in 79 countries. A sample of UNDAF’s reviewed – those for Colombia, Iran and Nigeria – all reflect the contribution of UNODC. A survey of UNODC staff views on future engagement with the UN development system indicated that staff want a “greater and more transparent role within UNDAF/UNPAF [United Nations Partnership Framework]”. Global and thematic programmes are designed without reference to UNDAFs. <br>The tracking spreadsheet mentioned above highlights UNDAF outcomes that are relevant to UNODC mandates but does not allow an analysis of how UNODC has aligned its programme with UNDAF outcomes. There is no systematic requirement for UNODC to ensure global and thematic programmes are aligned to UNDAF or other joint planning outcomes. This is an important gap, and, as a result, global and thematic programmes can sometimes duplicate in-country activities. <br>There is extensive evidence that UNODC participates in joint programming with other UN and other agencies. Working in partnerships appears to be a strength of UNODC. UNODC has established joint projects and co-ordination groups that involve a range of other entities of the United Nations system. These include access to justice for children (the United Nations Children’s Fund), gender equality and women’s empowerment (UN Women), drug prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (the World Health Organization (WHO), border management (the World Customs Organization), corruption (the United Nations Development Programme), trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling (the International Organization for Migration, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons), and terrorism prevention (the Office of Counter-Terrorism of the Secretariat and the entities established in connection with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact). The Office is also a co-sponsor of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and is the substantive leader in the area of HIV prevention, treatment and care among people who use drugs, including in prison settings. UNODC is also engaged in delivering a Joint Action Plan with the Secretariat of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.<br>There is evaluative evidence that UNODC is preparing to report against several SDG indicators jointly. UNODC, is the custodian of 15 SDG indicators, on its own or jointly with other agencies. It has a particular focus on SDG 16, with its targets of promoting the rule of law through addressing transnational threats such as organised crime, trafficking, terrorism and corruption; SDG 3 with its emphasis on combatting drug use, dependence and related HIV; SDG 15 on wildlife crime; and SDG 11 on safer cities.<br>There is evidence of the identification of shared information gaps with partners and strategies developed to address these. The flagship reports that UNODC produces on drugs and crime are explicitly targeted at identifying information gaps. For example, as part of its role in servicing the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, UNODC collects data on the implementation of the 2009 Declaration on narcotic drugs. It collects data annually on drug use and drug trafficking and identifies what member states do on drug prevention, treatment and care, every two years. These reports fill a gap in global information and inform future action.<br>UNODC is beginning to undertake decentralised Joint Evaluations. For example, two evaluations were conducted with UNDP. No strategic- or programme-level joint evaluations have yet been undertaken. Planning for a joint strategic evaluation is underway for the Global Counter Terrorism Strategy. UNODC has shared its evaluation plans with UNAIDS, to ensure there is synergy in areas of mutual interest.',

The guidance for CRP2 proposals states that “the overall objective of CGIAR policy is to open CGIAR’s trove of research data and associated information for indexing and interlinking by a robust, demand-driven cyberinfrastructure for agriculture, ensuring that research outputs are open via FAIR principles – that is, they are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable to enhance innovation, impact, and uptake.” <br>The Assessment Criteria for CGIAR’s six Program Performance Standards for 2019-2021 reports, “CGIAR is moving towards compliance with the International Aid Transparency Initiative”. Further, the overarching aim is that: “CGIAR programmes and projects [are] adequately transparent to international standards, such as IATI”.<br>There is a commitment to moving CGIAR towards compliance with the IATI standards. There is already a significant amount of information publicly available on CGIAR’s programming, budgeting and management, including: funding and budgeting, through the CGIAR Trust Fund dashboard; and CRPs and programming, through CG Space. The dashboard, in particular, aims to ensure that data is available to partners without the need to submit queries, as well as to ensure accuracy and quality.',

UNIDO has been publishing data since October 2018 on a monthly basis on the IATI website.<br>Reports are made to partners of evaluation findings and lessons. Mid-term and final evaluations are shared with stakeholders. Lessons are also communicated to governments and other stakeholders; briefing materials are prepared for donors and permanent missions. Field offices prepare annual reports and aggregate project information; this is generally for internal use but can also be used as part of ad hoc requests for UN partners or government and other local partners, once any sensitive information has been edited out. Project managers report progress, budgets and workplans to project steering committees, where they are reviewed and queries are addressed. Annual reports and financial statements are submitted to the donor. PCP programme managers report to national steering committees on PCP progress. There was no evidence on the timeliness of responses to partner queries, and partners noted that responses can be slow. <br>The Open Data Platform provides standard high level information; many UNIDO projects also have their own website. The India country evaluation notes, “There is room to expand information sharing across partners both within and beyond the programme”, suggesting that more can be done in relation to information to partners. Overall the partner survey shows an average response to UNIDO’s information sharing. Those working for UN agencies/IFIs or in the private sector tend to give less positive ratings than those working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs), international NGOs, academia or thinktanks.',

However, UNODC has yet to be informed when the Secretariat-wide roll-out to participate in IATI will be possible. UNODC is unlikely to be able to participate in the IATI independently of the UN Secretariat, as it is dependent on the UN Secretariat’s implementation of forthcoming enhancements to Umoja to be able to publish data to IATI.

    'value': 'Beneficiaries of UNIDO projects are not often well defined. This partly reflects the variety of project types and project purposes supported by UNIDO. Beneficiaries, as defined in documentation and by interviewees, may include some or all of the following: small and medium-sized enterprises; employees; people trained; women; youth; local communities; ministries; governments; the business sector; consumers; and society at large. Processes for accountability are also not well defined.<br>The ESSPP require the project development team to consult with project stakeholders for all UNIDO projects. For projects determined to be Category A or Category B, Public Consultation and Disclosure (PCD) sections must be included in the project. Results of consultations and the relevant documentation will be distributed to key stakeholders and affected groups. For Category A and B projects, consultations with stakeholders take place before the terms of reference (TORs) are finalised. Guidance states that in “identifying stakeholders, the project development team should consider the following: (i) which parties will be adversely affected and are the most vulnerable, and at what stage of project development?; (ii) what the various interests and likely positions of stakeholders?; (iii) what is the optimal sequence of engagement?; and (iv) are there any representative and accountable NGOs and community-based organisations to engage with?” In addition, the ESSPP guidance requires that “[i]n order to fulfil its commitment to accountability to the countries it aims to support, UNIDO will carry out meaningful consultations with the affected communities and all project stakeholders throughout the life of UNIDO projects”. However, the ESSPP were only rolled out from early 2019 for non-GEF projects, so that few projects to date have been required to be compliant with these requirements.<br>Technical Cooperation Guidelines for projects and programmes require project managers to identify target beneficiaries and provide some guidance on how to identify them and to assess whether the intervention will address their problems. The Guidelines require that some beneficiaries should be consulted during the project. Approval functions set out in the Technical Cooperation Guidelines and the ESSPP require beneficiaries and stakeholders to be identified, although this is not always clearly done in practice according to reviewed documentation. Accountability to line ministries, government and partners on the joint steering is provided through the regular project reporting processes; accountability requirements for other beneficiaries is not specified. Training on the use of the Technical Cooperation Guidelines appears to be “on the job”. Training is being provided for the ESSPP as it is rolled out.<br>The 2019 IRPF sets out new indicators for impact and outcomes which may enable a clearer definition of and focus on beneficiaries. The 2019 IRPF appears to identify small and medium-sized enterprises, employees, governments and consumers as potential beneficiaries and uses a methodology which enables projects to identify indicators relevant to their scope and purpose. There is a strong focus in the 2018 UNIDO evaluation manual on beneficiary definition and interaction and on beneficiaries’ and stakeholders’ feedback and perceptions. There is a similar requirement to address these issues in the standard UNIDO TOR for mid-term reviews.',

This includes a very broad range of institutions and individuals –representing both the state and civil society. These groups are beneficiaries of UNODC’s normative work as well as its training/capacity-building and field-based interventions. <br>UNODC’s new handbook on results-based management makes repeated reference to the need for the interests of beneficiaries to be embedded in programming processes. This spans from identifying who will benefit, to whether beneficiaries could be negatively impacted, to ensuring that results are posited from the perspective of beneficiary groups. <br>UNODC’s project document template requires staff to state how they will be involved in monitoring and in evaluation. UNODC’s Evaluation Handbook states that those designing an evaluation should consult beneficiaries to ensure their concerns are addressed by the evaluation. UNODC’s definition of “relevance” in evaluations is the extent to which, among other things, the objectives of a development intervention are consistent with beneficiaries’ requirements.',

    'value': 'UNIDO does not allocate funding to project partners directly, although this may change with the introduction of pilots of Project Executing Entities (PEE). UNIDO’s budget for allocation to project activities is almost completely funded by its voluntary contributions budget. Voluntary contributions are made by member states and other donors for earmarked project activities. The regular budget largely funds UNIDO’s administrative and policy-making functions and at present is allocated on the basis of historic expenditure, subject to any variations in requirements such as restructuring, new obligations or external pressures such as UN reform. Overall this indicator does not fully apply to UNIDO.<br>UNIDO does not use criteria for allocating or selecting projects and funding but does use the organisational priorities to describe investment in projects funded by voluntary contributions:<br> creating shared prosperity <br> advancing economic competitiveness <br> safeguarding the environment<br> strengthening knowledge and institutions.<br>These priorities frame UNIDO’s programmatic activities in the three thematic priorities of ISID, with the additional fourth priority made in the MTPF 2018-21 following revision of the MTPF 2016-19 priorities. These are published in the MTPF. There are no documented criteria for allocation of UNIDO funds for technical co-operation which would enable relative prioritisation of projects to select for development and implementation.<br>There has been a recent shift in UNIDO’s approach to allocating funding in a more strategic way aligned to ISID priorities and impact. The PCP countries are selected partly on the basis that they can make a strong contribution to ISID, i.e. in a more strategic way related to delivering ISID. <br>Six per cent of the regular budget (approximately EUR 4 million) is kept available for project activities for technical co-operation or ad hoc requirements. The DG and his senior management team (the “Executive Board”, EB) have discretion on how it is used. Proposals for use are brought to the EB above a EUR 30 000 threshold; below this threshold two Managing Directors on their own can decide the use of funds. There is no explicit methodology or rationale used for allocation of this fund by the “Executive Board” or Managing Directors.<br>The organisational approach to the allocation of resources, as framed by the Programme Budget, is “in transition” to be aligned gradually to the new MTPF/IRPF. This is intended to change UNIDO’s approach to managing for results, moving from a volume-based model to one maximising its developmental impact. This has the potential to enable a more strategic prioritisation and allocation of funding.<br>The organisational policy, as set out in the Programme Budget and MTPF is publicly available, although with the limitations as observed above in this MI narrative. At present it does not set out criteria for allocation.',

    'value': 'UNODC’s donors largely determine how resources are allocated. UNODC has limited discretionary finance – unearmarked funding – and is therefore highly dependent on donors’ priorities. It has limited freedom to choose interventions and therefore allocate resources to partners. It does have discretion over the use of its regular budget (7%, USD 22.4 million in 2018) and programme support costs (6%, USD 21.4 million in 2018). These resources are allocated in line with its budget and are rarely allocated to partners. <br>When implementing an intervention that has been financed by a donor, UNODC does have the power to choose how to allocate resources to implementation partners. UNODC’s Framework on Engaging External Parties (FEEP) and subsidiary manuals spell out how staff should select implementing partners and grant recipients: the framework sets out the principles and criteria guiding how to engage external parties. When it is introduced, Umoja Extension 2 (UE2) should allow UNODC to map the entire contract and partner system and monitor it, providing a unified database. The new Umoja function to track projects was designed by the UN Secretariat without any substantive input from UNODC, according to UNODC staff: there is therefore a risk that it does not fully meet UNODC’s needs. UNODC has access to a database of sanctioned implementors. <br>The FEEP provides guidance on whether programmes should use direct implementation or implementation partnerships and spells out modalities to use under direct implementation (i.e. grants and procurement). The FEEP guides staff on how to manage the award and the post-award stages of a relationship and provides guidance on performance monitoring and closure.<br>UNODC created a separate unit in 2013, the External Engagement Partnership Unit, to manage and oversee the allocation of resources to partners. <br>A 2017 internal audit report of the adequacy and effectiveness of the FEEP concluded that it generally achieved its main objectives, including strengthening controls on disbursements and closure of external party agreements, while noting that some aspects of the framework and its implementation needed to be strengthened.<br>UNODC reviews and updates its targeting and prioritisation framework every two years in its biennium programme and budget. <br>UNODC’s programme and budgets are publicly available.',

    'value': 'The secretariat does not set clear targets for disbursement. Rather, disbursement is responsive to context and resources, consequently firm targets are not expected to apply. Disbursement is based on XB fund availability. Nonetheless, once plans for disbursement have been approved, they occur efficiently and within agreed margins.<br>Depending on the donor, different requirements apply. Here, too, UNCTAD operates within UN Secretariat regulations and rules, and it applies these rigorously and efficiently. For example, the average request completion time by type of service and client for the period January-June 2019 was a mere 1.7 days. Since the introduction of the dashboard, and with the improvements made to Umoja, the average number of days for completion of payment requests in the automated TC Trust Fund Documents System went down from 27.4 days in 2018 to 20.8 days in 2019.<br>RMS is in charge and monitors disbursements and reporting to divisions and to the OSG on a monthly basis through the Dashboards on Trust Fund Management and Management Information. Since its introduction in 2018, the dashboard has contributed significantly to greater transparency and accountability. Interviewees point to improvements in shortening deadlines, as well as access to financial data for project officers and managers. There is quarterly monitoring against progress using financial data. TCS monitors expenditures and may discuss with the directors if there are any issues with implementation. Additionally, for UN Development Account projects, there is an annual report submitted each year to UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.<br>There is financial information available on variance, but TC performance management in terms of tracking of achievements at output and outcome levels is weak. Variances to timely disbursement often relate to external factors, e.g. realities on the ground that affect the planning and implementation of TC.',

    'value': 'UNIDO’s model does not use disbursements. Some projects permit officials in line ministries to approve transactions on UNIDO’s behalf, but these still use UNIDO systems and are not disbursements. Interviews reported that there has been some reluctance from some project managers to adopt this model which removes some of their control. Project managers delegate execution responsibility in a way that remains accountable and traceable; partners use their systems and commit expenditure on UNIDO’s behalf. <br>A new approach is now being piloted in China, with Project Executing Entities (PEE) responsible for carrying out GEF projects on UNIDO’s behalf. In this model, rather than UNIDO disbursing funds, the PEE has direct access to the SAP and UNIDO systems so the PEE can authorise payments, within the parameters of the budget and levels of delegated authority. Implementation authority is delegated in this model. Given the number of projects undertaken by UNIDO, this delegated model is seen as a potential way forward for some projects in some countries, which may help address UNIDO’s capacity and resource constraints. <br>There are no standardised targets for payments which would allow assessment of whether they are made in time. Payment stages are tailored and adjusted to the needs of the project and controlled by the allotment holder. From the way this is implemented (see below), there is a highly flexible model in place, which makes variances in payments from budget difficult to identify. The Finance team track expenditure and activity rates on ERP, inform project managers of expenditure against budget, and report to donors on expenditure against budget and progress. The model is highly centralised, with Vienna-based allotment holders overseeing and approving payments to project staff in the country. Currently there is a high level tracking of project financial implementation but not against targets. Expenditure profiles on the Open Data portal show many projects are slow to implement. <br>Concerns with timely payments are noted in the partner survey, in response to the question “UNIDO provides reliable information on when financial allocations, disbursements and payments will happen and for how much”, which has relatively negative findings. The majority of comments made by partners referred to disbursement delays and were negative.<br>Explanations for delays are not clearly stated, for instance there is not a regular review of reasons for delay. This may reflect the individualised project approach to management and lack of system-wide targets.<br>Variances in disbursements and delays are due to both internal and external factors. An evaluation of the India Country Programme for example found there to be “a high level of delays across the portfolio. Recurring efficiency problems relate both to UNIDO – procurement, human resources and contractual-related delays, and to the [country government]”.',

    'value': 'There is evidence that, generally, allocated resources are disbursed as planned. UNODC has systems in place to track variances and disbursements. Variances relate to a combination of internal and external factors. <br>Each programme sets clear targets for disbursement – whether to partners or by its own programme staff for projects under direct implementation. Costed workplans set out key activity milestones and the quarter they are supposed to be implemented. Programme management staff are responsible for continuously monitoring whether financial targets are achieved. If there are variances, forms require staff to record what corrective action is taken or planned. Each UNODC intervention submits two reports a year, which include reporting on variances. An OIOS review of 24 contribution agreements made under one global programme (strengthening the legal regime against terrorism) for 2015 and 2016 reviewed earmarked funding totalling USD 24 million and concluded that controls and disbursement of earmarked funding for the programme were adequate. <br>UNODC is strengthening the quality of its analysis of budget variances in response to a recommendation of the Audit Board and intends to improve tracking in future. The Board’s 2015 audit recommended that UNODC simplify the reporting structure. As reported in the Board’s audit of 2018, UNODC states that this recommendation is under implementation – and is looking at whether it can integrate Umoja and a donor reporting dashboard with the UE2 enhancements (for the fourth quarter of 2020). <br>Financial statements reviewed indicate that planned disbursements are tracked. Institutionally agreed disbursement margins are embedded in donor agreements. The Audit Board did not consider the timeliness of disbursements an issue of concern, and there were no related recommendations in either its 2017 or 2018 audits. <br>Clear explanations are generally available in relation to variances. UNODC’s running spreadsheet notes whether each variance is justified and states the justification or explanation. Variances relate to both internal and external factors. They are often due to political issues or delays related to the national government, local partners or donors. Explanations in the sample report of variances from 2018 shared by UNODC show this clearly. Evaluations find that the causes are varied. The Audit Board also reports on variances in UNODC’s overall annual budget and cites explanations. In 2018, the highest value was on overspend caused by the higher-than-budgeted value of a terrorism prevention subprogramme. <br>Some delays are reported to be related to UNODC as an implementing agency. For example, the Final In-depth evaluation of the Regional Programme for the Arab States found that recurring efficiency problems related to “a combination of complex factors”. It was also noted that “one reported impediment to projects’ efficiency is the UNODC lengthy recruitment process of both internal staff and external experts”.',

    'value': 'Detailed financial planning and budgeting is core to the Fund. The inventory of approved project proposals records every project that has been approved since 1991. It contains detailed information including the substance to be phased out, the amount used and the substance to be phased in. Project proposals detail target levels of the controlled substances to be phased out (the results of the MP) and the level of funds required. At every meeting of the EXCOM, the Treasurer provides a document on the status of contributions and disbursements, as well as a report on balances and the availability of resources. Interviews and documents confirm that budget allocations are aligned with the objectives of the MP – and specifically Article 5 country progress towards agreed compliance targets –, but there is no single budget document that identifies the funds allocated to specific substances. <br>Costs per tonne of ozone depleting potential (ODP) removed and destroyed are calculated in a number of documents. The consolidated business plan shows allocations by each HCFC and HFC activity.<br> No system was found relating to Element 3 for the MLF. The previous MOPAN assessments reported no evidence for the World Bank, a system in development for UNEP and no system for UNIDO. Only UNDP has a system of this type. <br>Interview evidence from both the Secretariat and IAs suggests that costing has always been very thorough, with little scope for improving the system. Costs per tonne are presented over time in the annual performance assessment of the IAs and in the progress reports. However, these show unexplained variances (possibly due to the different chemicals and programmes) and do not show evidence of improved costing over time.',

    'value': 'This MI has been interpreted at the TC project level.<br>Because the subprogramme and budget proposals do not include XB-funded TC interventions, the overall organisational budget does not align financial resources with strategic results in the TC pillar. Instead, TC budgets are developed on a per project basis. <br>Following an OIOS audit of UNCTAD, selected projects in the Division of Investment and Enterprise (in 2017), UNCTAD reviewed the TC submission templates and revised the project clearance checklist to ensure that the applicable budgetary methodology is followed. With regard to new requests for TC, project officers were henceforth required to provide a cost estimate/budget for each request. Results-based budgeting principles are not yet being applied to the budgets for TC in compliance with UN Secretariat regulations.<br>Despite improvements to Umoja in some areas, staff experience difficulties in using the platform to track TC performance from activity through to result (outcome). In response, most interviewees have developed their own parallel system to track the performance of their project(s). From 2020 onwards, the UN is moving to an annual planning and budgeting cycle which is intended to improve flexibility and accountability for results, also at the project level. Due to a lack of resources and delays in the roll-out of the (UN Secretariat-wide system) Umoja 2 functionalities that should allow for an integrated results-based budgeting and performance tracking for TC interventions, for the time being, UNCTAD does not have an information technology system available to support the tracking of expenditure to results. The finance section within RMS monitors expenditures on a monthly basis in an Excel programme and shares these with the divisions at least once a month.',
