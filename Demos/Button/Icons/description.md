To add an icon to a **Button**, set the **icon** property. This demo shows how you can use this property:   

- **Built-in icons**    
DevExtreme ships with its own [icon library](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Icons/#Built-In_Icon_Library). Pick any icon and assign its name to the **icon** property.

- **Image file**    
Set the **icon** value to the image file path or URI.    

- **3rd-party icon fonts**    
You can import a 3rd-party font library (this example uses <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>). In such cases, set the **icon** property to a name that identifies the required glyph. Look up names in the imported library's documentation.

- **Buttons with icons and no caption text**   
Define the **icon**, but do not define the **text** property. You can use the [hint](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxButton/Configuration/#hint) property to annotate the **button**.   

Refer to the [Icons](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Icons) help topic for additional information.
