Text editors have built-in action buttons that allow users to open a drop-down menu, increase, decrease, or nullify the value, and perform other actions. To add custom action buttons for different scenarios, use the [buttons[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTextBox/Configuration/buttons/) array.

Each object in the **buttons[]** array should have the [name](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTextBox/Configuration/buttons/#name) field&mdash;the button's identifier. In addition, specify the button's [location](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTextBox/Configuration/buttons/#location) relative to the input text field and [options of the Button UI component](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTextBox/Configuration/buttons/#options) used as the action button.

The **buttons[]** array also accepts string values&mdash;the names of built-in buttons. Declare them in the order the buttons should have in the UI component. String and object declarations can be used in the same array.
