In&nbsp;this demo, the DevExtreme **Chart** UI component is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;create&nbsp;a [Pareto chart][0]. This example of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Pareto chart summarizes complaints about the service provided by&nbsp;a&nbsp;pizza shop. From this chart, the pizza shop owner may infer that to&nbsp;satisfy most of&nbsp;the customers, he&nbsp;or&nbsp;she needs to&nbsp;eliminate two most frequently encountered issues: delayed delivery and cold pizza.
