This demo illustrates the sparklines of&nbsp;the _bar_ type. A&nbsp;number of&nbsp;properties for each sparkline is&nbsp;changed. Most of&nbsp;these properties define the appearance of&nbsp;specific sparkline elements. Note that in&nbsp;this demo, the **Sparkline** UI component obtains data using the **DataSource** object. You can change filtering conditions for the data using the drop-down menu under the table.
