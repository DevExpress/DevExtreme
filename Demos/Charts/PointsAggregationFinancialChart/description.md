The Chart UI component can aggregate series points. To enable this feature, set the **aggregation**.[enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/aggregation/#enabled) property of a [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/) to **true**. 

In this demo, the Chart is bound to the [RangeSelector](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/) UI component. If you set the selection to a wide range, the control will use a higher aggregation degree, and vice versa.

Aggregation on zoom is one of many possible use cases for this feature. For information on how to configure aggregation for other scenarios, refer to the following description: [aggregation](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/aggregation/).
