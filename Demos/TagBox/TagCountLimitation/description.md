You can use the [maxDisplayedTags](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTagBox/Configuration/#maxDisplayedTags) property to limit the number of displayed tags. When the specified limit is exceeded, the tags are combined into a single multi-tag that displays the number of selected items. Use the [showMultiTagOnly](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTagBox/Configuration/#showMultiTagOnly) property to specify whether to display a multi-tag only or other tags as well. You can also use [onMultiTagPreparing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTagBox/Configuration/#onMultiTagPreparing) event handler to customize the multi-tag, as shown in the second example.
