DevExtreme JavaScript Tree List is a powerful Vue UI component for visualizing hierarchical data in a grid. It is so flexible that you do not need to feed it hierarchical data structures. Even with a collection of linked plain objects, the Tree List can still build a tree hierarchy. Its other key features include data editing and validation, sorting, filtering, and searching, adaptability, and many more. You can use Vue syntax and techniques to instantiate and configure the Tree List or handle its events. In addition, the UI component supports [prop validation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation) and templates that use [named slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Named-Slots).
