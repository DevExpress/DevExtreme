Filter and search results depend on the [filterMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTreeList/Configuration/#filterMode) property. The **TreeList** supports the following modes:
 
- *"matchOnly"*    
  The results include only rows that meet the filter condition.

- *"withAncestors"*    
  The results include rows that meet the filter condition and their ancestors.

- *"fullBranch"*    
  The results include rows that meet the filter condition and their ancestors and descendants.
