The **TabPanel** is&nbsp;a&nbsp;widget consisting of&nbsp;the **Tabs** and the **MultiView** widgets. It&nbsp;automatically synchronizes the selected tab with the currently displayed view and vice versa. In&nbsp;this demo, the appearance of&nbsp;views and tabs is&nbsp;defined by&nbsp;custom templates.
