This demo illustrates how to configure the FileManager to manage files and folders in Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. To access the Azure Blob Storage, the UI component uses the [Remote File System Provider](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileManager/File_System_Providers/Remote).
This file system provider allows you to access the storage's file system on the client side. To process the HTTP requests on the server, create your own file system provider that implements the [IFileSystemItemLoader](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.IFileSystemItemLoader), [IFileSystemItemEditor](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.IFileSystemItemEditor), [IFileUploader](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.IFileUploader) and [IFileContentProvider](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.IFileContentProvider) interfaces.
