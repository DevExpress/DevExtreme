[note]The [SlideOut](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSlideOut/) component is deprecated as of v21.1. We recommend that you use the [Drawer](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Drawer/Getting_Started_with_Navigation_Drawer/) component instead.

The SlideOut component is a classic slide-out menu paired with a view. A user opens the menu by swiping away the view. This demo shows how to group menu items and how to define custom templates for the view and group headers.
