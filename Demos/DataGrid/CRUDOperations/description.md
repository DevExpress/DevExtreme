This demo shows how to&nbsp;implement remote CRUD operations in&nbsp;the **CustomStore**. You can view the server implementation under the *DataGridWebApiController* tab in&nbsp;the ASP.NET MVC version of&nbsp;this demo. The requests sent to&nbsp;the server are displayed under the **DataGrid**.
 
After a&nbsp;cell is&nbsp;edited, the **DataGrid** can behave differently depending on&nbsp;the selected refresh mode: reload data from the server (the [refreshMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#refreshMode) is&nbsp;full), reapply data processing operations (reshape), or&nbsp;merely rerender the changed cells (repaint).
