The **DataGrid** UI component is optimized for real-time updates. You should bind it to a [DataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/) that contains a store and use the [push(changes)](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/ArrayStore/Methods/#pushchanges) method to update the store's data. The rows with changed data are rerendered (see the **DataGrid**'s [repaintChangesOnly](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#repaintChangesOnly) property). The **DataSource** object also provides properties that control its behavior when it receives a push. For example, [reshapeOnPush](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#reshapeOnPush) is set to **true** in this demo to allow summaries to be recalculated.
 
Grids in the detail sections are updated in real time as well. All the grids share the same `ordersStore` that receives pushes, but it is filtered to show only a specific product's orders for each grid.
