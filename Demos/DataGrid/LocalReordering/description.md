The **DataGrid** allows users to drag and drop rows. Use the icon to the left of the row as the drag handle.

To enable this feature, set the [allowReordering](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/rowDragging/#allowReordering) property to **true** and change the row index in the [onReorder](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/rowDragging/#onReorder) function.

Use the [rowDragging](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/rowDragging/) object to configure the row drag and drop feature.
