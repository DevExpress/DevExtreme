DevExtreme supports right-to-left layouts. To change a layout to RTL, set the UI component's [rtlEnabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#rtlEnabled) property to **true**. You can also set **rtlEnabled** to **true** in the project's [globalConfig](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/globalConfig/) to apply RTL to all UI components in your application.

In this demo, you can use the drop-down menu to switch between the different layouts. Note that this demo updates the [dataField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#dataField) and [caption](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#caption) properties to display translated content when you change the **rtlEnabled** value.
