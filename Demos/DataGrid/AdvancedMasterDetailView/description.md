This demo illustrates an advanced master-detail view in the DataGrid UI component. Master rows represent suppliers. Detail sections contain TabPanel UI components with two tabs: Orders and Address. In the Orders tab, you can choose a supplier's product from the SelectBox, and the DataGrid under it will show orders placed on this product. The Address tab displays the supplier's address.
