DevExtreme includes two interactive HTML5 JavaScript UI components for mapping: HTML5 JavaScript Map, which allows creating GPS navigation maps, works with data from Google Maps and Bing Maps, supports roadmap, satellite, and hybrid views, and allows a user to create markers and routes; HTML5 JavaScript Vector Map, which allows creating vector maps, ships with several predefined data sources, a variety of colorization modes, and multiple legends. Both components are available as AngularJS directives and support two-way binding to scope properties and declarative configuration.
