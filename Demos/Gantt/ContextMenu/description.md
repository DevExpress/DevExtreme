Our feature-complete Gantt UI component allows you to create and customize its context menu as needed. Use the [contextMenu](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxGantt/Configuration/contextMenu/) property and [contextMenuPreparing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxGantt/Configuration/#onContextMenuPreparing) event to access and manage context menu items.
