Our feature-complete **Gantt** widget allows you to create and customize its context menu as needed. Use the [contextMenu](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxGantt/Configuration/contextMenu/) option and [contextMenuPreparing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxGantt/Configuration/#onContextMenuPreparing) event to access and manage context menu items.
