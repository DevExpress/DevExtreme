The **ResponsiveBox** UI component allows you to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;application or&nbsp;a&nbsp;website with a&nbsp;layout adapted to&nbsp;different screen sizes. In&nbsp;this demo, each element on&nbsp;the page is&nbsp;a&nbsp;**ResponsiveBox** element whose location is&nbsp;specified for each possible screen size.
