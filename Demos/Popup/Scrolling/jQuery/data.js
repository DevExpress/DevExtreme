Horizontal scrolling is available only if the content is wider than the <b>ScrollView</b>. Otherwise, the content adapts to the widget's width.<br/><br/>The <b>ScrollView</b> uses native scrolling on most platforms, except desktops. To use it on all platforms, assign <b>true</b> to the <b>useNative</b> option. If you assign <b>false</b>, scrolling is simulated on all platforms.";
