The FileUploader component allows an&nbsp;end user to&nbsp;upload files to&nbsp;the server. This demo illustrates the use of&nbsp;the FileUploader within a&nbsp;web page. To&nbsp;select a&nbsp;file using the **Open file** dialog, click the _Select photo_ button. Note that the **Open file** dialog only accepts image file types as&nbsp;the **accept** configuration property of&nbsp;the FileUploader is&nbsp;set to&nbsp;_&laquo;image/\*&raquo;_. 

To see an example of server-side implementation, refer to the **HTML Form Upload** article for [ASP.NET](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/FileUploader/Upload_Files/Server-Side_Implementation_in_ASP.NET/#HTML_Form_Upload) or [PHP](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/FileUploader/Upload_Files/Server-Side_Implementation_in_PHP/#HTML_Form_Upload).

**NOTE:** This demo does not actually upload the selected file. To&nbsp;upload a&nbsp;file, submit the form. The form element should contain the **action** attribute, which holds the URL of&nbsp;the page providing server scenarios for saving uploaded files.
