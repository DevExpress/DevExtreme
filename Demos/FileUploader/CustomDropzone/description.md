The FileUploader widget supports the drag&drop functionality to upload files.

In this demo, the [dropZone](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#dropZone) option specifies the HTML element in which you can drag and drop files for upload. The [dropZoneEnter](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#onDropZoneEnter) and [dropZoneLeave](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#onDropZoneLeave) events allow you to customize the drop zone when the mouse pointer enters and leaves this zone while dragging the file.
