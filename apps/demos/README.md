# DevExtreme Demos

This repository contains technical DevExtreme demos for Angular, React, Vue, jQuery, ASP.NET MVC, and ASP.NET Core.

To run the demos on your machine, clone this repository, run `npm install`, and follow the instructions below.

## Prepare Demos for Development
Before running you need execute in `monorepo/root`:

```
npm run all:build
npm run overwrite-wrappers-packages
```

To prepare demos for development:

```
npm run prepare-js
```

Angular, Vue, and React demos can use bundles instead of separate files from `node_modules`. With bundles, demos launch faster but become harder to debug. Run the following command to create the bundles and replace the SystemJS configuration:

```
npm run prepare-bundles
```

To return to using separate files from `node_modules`, run `npm run prepare-js`.


### Launch

#### Option 1
```
npm run launch-demo
```

#### Option 2
1. Run ```run npm webserver ``` from `monorepo/root`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/apps/demos.

You can pass additional parameter to specify port. It can be useful when you need to fast switching between one demo on different frameworks:

### TS React Infrastructure

1. After you make any changes in React TypeScript sources, run the following command:

```
npm run convert-to-js split
```

If you want to run this script on specific folder you can pass it to the arguments

```
