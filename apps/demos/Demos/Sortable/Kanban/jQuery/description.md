The [Sortable](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSortable/) component allows users to reorder elements using drag and drop. In this demo, two different Sortables are used. They are declared in the `renderKanban` and `renderCards` functions:

- `renderKanban`        
In this function, Sortable allows users to reorder card lists. It is attached to a `<div>` that contains the kanban board, but the [filter](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSortable/Configuration/#filter) property allows sorting only list elements. The [handle](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSortable/Configuration/#handle) property specifies that lists can be dragged by their titles. To correctly animate items being reordered, Sortable requires the item orientation. The [itemOrientation](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSortable/Configuration/#itemOrientation) property is set to *"horizontal"* because card lists are orientated horizontally.

- `renderCards`         
In this function, Sortable allows users to reorder cards. It is attached to the `$items` element (a container for all cards in a specific list). All Sortables are added to the same [group](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSortable/Configuration/#group) to allow users to move cards between lists.

In addition to Sortable, this kanban board implementation uses the [ScrollView](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/ScrollView/Overview/) component. The component's instance in the `renderKanban` function allows you to scroll the board left to right. The component's instance in the `renderCards` function makes lists scrollable.
