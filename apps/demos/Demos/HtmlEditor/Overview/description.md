The HtmlEditor component is a client-side WYSIWYG text editor. The editor allows users to format text and integrate media elements into documents. The result can be exported to HTML or Markdown.

Users can edit and customize content using the [toolbar](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/toolbar/) that can contain predefined and custom controls. To specify the available controls, use the [items](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/toolbar/items/) array. In this demo, the toolbar contains predefined controls.

You can use the **toolbar**.[multiline](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/toolbar/#multiline) property to arrange the toolbar controls into multiple rows.

Users can resize media files when the [mediaResizing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/mediaResizing/) is enabled. Currently, only images are supported.
