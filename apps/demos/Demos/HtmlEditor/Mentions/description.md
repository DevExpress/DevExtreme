Our HtmlEditor allows end-users to insert "mentions" and reference others within text or conversation threads as demonstrated in this demo. With this feature, you can introduce functionality that emulates capabilities found in collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams. 

A "mention" is triggered by a marker. You are free to choose a "marker" of your choice (this demo uses the `@` symbol to trigger a "mention").  User names are stored as items in a [dataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/mentions/#dataSource). Data can be retrieved from multiple data sources. When using multiple data sources, you must assign an unique marker to each. 

To "mention" a user, simply enter the `@` symbol and select the desired record from the "Mentions" drop-down user list. Like today's most popular collaboration tools, you can enter additional characters to filter the records displayed within the "Mentions" drop-down user list.
