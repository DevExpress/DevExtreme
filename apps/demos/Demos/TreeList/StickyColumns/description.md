Our next major release (v24.2) will include a new sticky columns option. Sticky columns remain static initially but start scrolling when they reach their position. Once scrolling moves past this point, they reattach to a different side of the table. This feature improves usability by displaying important columns in a specific view (ensuring continuous access to critical information).
