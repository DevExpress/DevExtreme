TreeList can display a popup edit form. The form can include any fields from the bound data source, regardless of whether the corresponding column is visible in the grid (see the `Head` column).

To enable this behavior in your application, do the following:
- Set **editing**.[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#mode) to *"popup"*.
- Set the [editing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/) object's [allowUpdating](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#allowUpdating), [allowAdding](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#allowAdding), and [allowDeleting](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#allowDeleting) properties to **true**.

TreeList uses the DevExtreme [Form](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxForm/) and [Popup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/) components to display the popup form. Their default configurations are defined automatically. If these configurations do not meet your requirements, you can redefine them in the **editing** object's [form](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#form) and [popup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#popup) properties. For more information about this edit mode's limitations, refer to the descriptions of these properties.
