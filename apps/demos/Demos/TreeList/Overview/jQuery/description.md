DevExtreme JavaScript TreeList control is a cross-breed of a tree view and data grid. This control is available as a jQuery plugin and can be bound to data from local arrays, JSON files, Web API and OData services, or custom remote services. This demo shows a slightly customized TreeList with selection, filtering, and column rearranging enabled. Move to other demos to explore more TreeList features, like sorting, data editing, adaptability, etc.
