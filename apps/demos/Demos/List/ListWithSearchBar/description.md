To add a search bar to the List and enable the search functionality, do the following:

- Set the [searchEnabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#searchEnabled) property to **true**.   

- Specify the [searchExpr](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#searchMode) property. It is used to compare the search string against a specific field in your data objects. In this example, the search string is compared against the *"Name"* field.

- Use the [searchMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#searchMode) property to specify whether list items should start with, contain, or match the search string. In this example, you can use the drop-down menu under the List to change the **searchMode**.
