This demo shows how to implement remote CRUD operations in the **CustomStore**. You can view the server implementation under the *DataGridWebApiController* tab in the ASP.NET MVC version of this demo. The requests sent to the server are displayed under the DataGrid.
 
After a cell is edited, the DataGrid can behave differently depending on the selected refresh mode: reload data from the server (the [refreshMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#refreshMode) is full), reapply data processing operations (reshape), or merely rerender the changed cells (repaint).
