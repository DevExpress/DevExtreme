Multiple users can edit the DataGrid's data in real-time. In this demo, changes made in one DataGrid are broadcasted to the other DataGrid via the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/signalr" target="blank">SignalR</a> service.

To implement this functionality:

1. Generate a session ID used to identify DataGrids that should be edited simultaneously (`groupId` in this demo).

1. Configure CustomStores. In this demo, we use the <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/blob/master/docs/client-side-with-jquery.md#api-reference" target="_blank">createStore</a> method (part of the <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data" target="_blank">DevExtreme.AspNet.data</a> extension). The <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/blob/master/docs/client-side-with-jquery.md#api-reference" target="blank">onBeforeSend</a> function is used to send the session ID from step 1 to the server.

1. Create store instances&mdash;one per DataGrid.

1. Create DataGrids and bind them to the store instances.

1. Update all the store instances when a push notification is received (see the `updateStores` function).

Changes made collaboratively are lost if you refresh the page because the **SignalR** service broadcasts changes without saving them.
