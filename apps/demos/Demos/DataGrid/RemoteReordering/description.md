This demo shows how to use drag and drop to reorder records stored on the server. This functionality requires that records' order indexes are in an individual data field (`OrderIndex` in this demo) and sorted against that field.

Row drag and drop is configured in the [rowDragging][5] object. Set [allowReordering][2] to **true** to enable this feature. To specify the highlight mode of the row's drop position, use the [dropFeedbackMode][6] property. In this demo, it is set to *"push"*: rows move up or down with animation to create space for the new position of the row.

When a row is dropped, the [onReorder][0] event handler is called. Use it to update the record's `OrderIndex` on the server. In this demo, we use the **onReorder** function's `toIndex` parameter to obtain the position at which a user dropped the row. The position is then used to get the new order index. The store's [update][1] method sends this index to the server where the records are sorted and returned to the client. Server-side implementation is available in the [ASP.NET Core][3] and [ASP.NET MVC 5][4] versions of this demo under the `DataGridRowReorderingController.cs` tab.
