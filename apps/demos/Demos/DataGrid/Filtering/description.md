This example demonstrates the DataGrid&rsquo;s built-in filtering and searching capabilities. The filter row, located under the column headers, allows a&nbsp;user to&nbsp;type any value and select filter operations. With the header filter, which is&nbsp;called by&nbsp;clicking the filter icon in&nbsp;any column header, a&nbsp;user can choose from a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;predefined values. The search panel at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the DataGrid allows searching for values in&nbsp;all columns at&nbsp;once.
