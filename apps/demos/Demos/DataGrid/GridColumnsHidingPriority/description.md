When the DataGrid adapts its layout to smaller screens, it hides columns based on the [hidingPriority](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#hidingPriority). Columns with lower values are hidden first. 

In this demo, the `CustomerStoreCity` column is hidden in vertical and horizontal orientation modes because its **hidingPriority** is 0. The `CustomerStoreState` and `OrderDate` columns have a priority of 1 and 2. The DataGrid hides these columns after the `CustomerStoreCity` column, only when the screen orientation is vertical.
