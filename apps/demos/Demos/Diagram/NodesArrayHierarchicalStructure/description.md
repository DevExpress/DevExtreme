This demo shows the Diagram's ability to load an external tree structure from a hierarchical object. 

The component binds to a data object specified by the [dataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/Configuration/nodes/#dataSource) property. You should set the [itemsExpr](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/Configuration/nodes/#itemsExpr) property to the name of the field that provides data for nested items due to the data's hierarchical structure.
