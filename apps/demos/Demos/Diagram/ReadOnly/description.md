The Diagram component can operate in Read Only mode. In this mode, users are not permitted to edit a diagram; therefore, most of the UI elements are disabled. It is for this reason that the Toolbox and Properties panel in this demo are hidden.

To switch the Diagram to Read Only mode, set the [readOnly](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/Configuration/#readOnly) property to true.
