This demo shows the Diagram component in Simple View mode. In this mode, the control does not divide the work area into pages and the diagram's content occupies all the available area inside the component. 

To enable Simple View mode, set the [simpleView](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/Configuration/#simpleView) property to true.
