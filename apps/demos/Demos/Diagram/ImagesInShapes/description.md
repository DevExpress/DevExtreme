The Diagram component provides shapes with images that are specially designed for use in OrgCharts. You can select a shape with the following image positions: on the left, right, or top of the shape. 

In this demo, the Diagram is bound to a data source. The [imageUrlExpr](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/Configuration/nodes/#imageUrlExpr) property specifies the name of a field that provides a path to images.
