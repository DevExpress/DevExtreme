The Diagram component allows you to bind a [customShapes](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/Configuration/customShapes/) collection to a data source. In this demo, the collection is bound to an array of employee objects. The Diagram creates a shape for every employee data item in the data source and adds the shapes to the "employees" category.  

The [toolbox](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/Configuration/toolbox/) property allows you to add custom categories to a data toolbox. 

Users can drag data items from the toolbox and drop them onto a canvas to create a diagram.
