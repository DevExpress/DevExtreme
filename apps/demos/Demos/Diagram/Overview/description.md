The DevExtreme JavaScript [Diagram](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/) provides a visual interface to be used when you design new diagrams or modify existing ones. This control is available as a jQuery plugin and can be bound to external data. The Diagram provides more than [40 resizable shapes](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Diagram/Shape_Types/), which you can drag and drop onto a page. Shapes and connectors are highly customizable.
