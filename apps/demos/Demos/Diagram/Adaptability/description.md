The Diagram can adapt its layout to narrow screens. In this demo, the component's **Height** property is set to 100% to fit a screen.

Note the following changes to the toolbox and properties panel:

* The toolbox is docked to the left component border.
* The properties panel is docked to the bottom component border.
* A tool slides out of the screen when a user drags a shape from the toolbox or edits an item's text.
* Only one tool can be displayed at a time.

You can switch between landscape and portrait layouts to see the Diagram's appearance and behavior on wide and narrow screens.
