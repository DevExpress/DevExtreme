DevExtreme DataGrid and TreeList ship with built-in paging support. We expect to release Pagination as a separate component to simplify data navigation/improve browsing. This component will allow users to navigate extensive datasets by dividing them into individual pages.

Pagination in full and compact modes:

<!--split-->
Primary features will include:

- **Page Navigator**\
Built-in controls allow users move between pages. Navigation buttons can be displayed or hidden.

- **Page Size Selector**\
Set the number of records per page and configure page size selection elements (display/hide the page size selector and customize page size).

- **Page Information**\
Display current page number and total record count. Custom text can be set for page information.

- **Responsive Design**\
Pagination will support full, compact, and adaptive display modes. In compact mode, Pagination will change the appearance of the page navigator and page selector to use screen space more efficiently. In adaptive mode, Pagination will automatically switch between full and compact based on content width.

- **Right-to-Left Support**\
Suitable for applications requiring internationalization.

- **Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation**\
Pagination will be fully accessible with keyboard navigation support.
