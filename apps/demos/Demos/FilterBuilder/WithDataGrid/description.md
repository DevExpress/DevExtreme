This demo shows how to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;standalone FilterBuilder to&nbsp;filter data in&nbsp;the DataGrid component. The DataGrid also has an&nbsp;integrated filter builder that can be&nbsp;invoked using the filter panel (see the [Filter Panel](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/FilterPanel/jQuery/Light/) demo).
