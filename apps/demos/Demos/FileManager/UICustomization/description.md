The FileManager component provides the following UI customization properties:

* The [toolbar](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileManager/Configuration/toolbar) property specifies the toolbar's visibility and available commands.
* The [contextMenu](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileManager/Configuration/contextMenu) property specifies the context menu's availability and its commands.

The toolbar and context menu support context-invariant and context-sensitive items that can be visible or hidden depending on user action.
