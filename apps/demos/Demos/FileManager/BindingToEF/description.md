The FileManager component allows you to manage file system items that use the Entity Framework ORM to link to a database. You can use the [Remote File System Provider](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileManager/File_System_Providers/Remote) to connect to the file system on the client side. To process the component's HTTP requests on the server, create your own file system provider, which implements the [IFileSystemItemLoader](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.IFileSystemItemLoader) and [IFileSystemItemEditor](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.IFileSystemItemEditor) interfaces.
