This demo shows the VectorMap zooming and centering capabilities. The map contains several cities represented by&nbsp;dot markers. To&nbsp;identify a&nbsp;city, pause on&nbsp;its marker, and the name of&nbsp;the city will appear in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tooltip. Moreover, if&nbsp;you click the marker, the map will be&nbsp;zoomed and centered on&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;code it&nbsp;is&nbsp;performed by&nbsp;calling the **center(centerCoordinates)** and **zoomFactor(zoomFactor)** methods. A&nbsp;click on&nbsp;the _&laquo;Reset&raquo;_ button restores default center coordinates and zoom factor.
