This demo shows how to&nbsp;color specific map areas using a&nbsp;palette. In&nbsp;the VectorMap component, a&nbsp;palette defines a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;colors that are used to&nbsp;paint areas. This range is&nbsp;divided into segments using the value assigned to&nbsp;the **colorGroups** property. Each segment contributes a&nbsp;color into an&nbsp;array of&nbsp;colors.



The map in&nbsp;this demo represents the top 40&nbsp;countries by&nbsp;population. Map areas are colored according to&nbsp;the percentage of&nbsp;population.
