DevExtreme Vue Maps are interactive UI components that enable you to&nbsp;display a&nbsp;GPS navigation map or&nbsp;a&nbsp;vector map (shown in&nbsp;this demo) in&nbsp;your application. You can use Vue syntax and techniques to&nbsp;instantiate and configure the maps or&nbsp;handle their events. In addition, the&nbsp;components support [prop validation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation) and templates that use [named slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Named-Slots). [Find out more about DevExtreme Vue components](/Documentation/Guide/Vue_Components/DevExtreme_Vue_Components/).

Use our DevExpress BI Dashboard to embed interactive business intelligence into your next web app.

The Web Dashboard is a data analysis UI component that you can embed into your ASP.NET Core or Angular, React, and Vue applications with .NET backend. Dashboards allow you to display multiple inter-connected data analysis elements such as grids, charts, maps, gauges, and others: all within an automatically-arranged layout.

The set of components allows you to deploy an all-in-one solution and switch between Viewer and Designer modes directly on the web client (includes adaptive layouts for tablet & mobile).

The Web Dashboard is available as a part of a Universal subscription.
