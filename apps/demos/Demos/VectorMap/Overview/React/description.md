DevExtreme React Maps include two interactive UI components for creating GPS navigation maps and vector maps. The Map component works with Google Maps and Bing Maps API, supports roadmap, satellite, and hybrid views, and allows a user to create markers and routes. The Vector Map component comes with predefined data sources, a variety of colorization modes, and multiple legends.

Use our DevExpress BI Dashboard to embed interactive business intelligence into your next web app.

The Web Dashboard is a data analysis UI component that you can embed into your ASP.NET Core or Angular, React, and Vue applications with .NET backend. Dashboards allow you to display multiple inter-connected data analysis elements such as grids, charts, maps, gauges, and others: all within an automatically-arranged layout.

The set of components allows you to deploy an all-in-one solution and switch between Viewer and Designer modes directly on the web client (includes adaptive layouts for tablet & mobile).

The Web Dashboard is available as a part of a Universal subscription.
