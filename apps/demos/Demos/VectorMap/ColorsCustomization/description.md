This demo shows how to color different map elements. The map represented here indicates the top ten largest countries in the world by means of colors. These colors are assigned to the map areas using the **customize** callback function of the **layers** object. Moreover, when one of the areas is selected or hovered over, its color changes to those specified by the **selectedColor** and **hoveredColor** properties.

Tooltips for the map areas representing the largest countries are customized as well. Using the **tooltip** | **customizeTooltip** callback function, they are colored identical to the areas themselves and display the total area of the country.
