The Button component supports several predefined color schemes. To apply a scheme, set the [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxButton/Configuration/#type) property to one of the following values:     

- *"normal"*    
- *"success"*
- *"default"*    
- *"danger"*      
<!--split-->

To further customize the Button, use the [stylingMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxButton/Configuration/#stylingMode) property. This property affects the fill and borders, and accepts the following values:    

- *"contained"*    
- *"outlined"*    
- *"text"*
