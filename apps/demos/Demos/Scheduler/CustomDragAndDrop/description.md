Appointment drag and drop is enabled out-of-the-box, but only if appointments are moved within the Scheduler. In this demo, appointments can be moved between the Scheduler  and a list. Follow the steps below to implement this functionality:

1. **Configure the Scheduler**       
In the [appointmentDragging][0] object, implement the [onAdd][2] function (in which you should [add an appointment][1]) and the [onRemove][4] function (in which you should [delete an appointment][3] and create a corresponding list item).

2. **Configure list items**      
Attach an instance of the [Draggable][5] component to every list item. The component has the [data][6] property that can contain custom data. In this demo, it is an appointment's subject. Implement the [onDragStart][7] function in which you should pass the subject to the Scheduler where it is used to add new appointments.

3. **Configure the list**        
Attach another Draggable instance to the list which only serves as the drop target. Implement the **onDragStart** function to ensure the list cannot be dragged.

4. **Add the controls to the same group**            
To enable drag and drop operations between the controls, assign the same value to the [group][8] property of the Scheduler's **appointmentDragging** object and both Draggable components.
