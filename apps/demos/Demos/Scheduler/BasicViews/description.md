This example demonstrates four Scheduler views: Day, Week, Work Week, and Month. You can use the View Switcher above the timetable to switch between them.

To add these views to your Scheduler, list them in the [views](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/) array. If you do not declare this array, users can switch only between the Day and Week views. To activate a specific view at application startup, use the [currentView](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#currentView) property.

For more information about supported view types, refer to the following help topic: [View Types](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Scheduler/Views/View_Types/).
