Timeline views display appointments as a sequence of events on a horizontal timeline, as opposed to basic views that display appointments in a calendar format. You can use the View Switcher above the timetable to switch between the views.

List timeline views in the [views](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/) array to add them to your Scheduler. To activate a specific view at application startup, use the [currentView](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#currentView) property.

For information about all supported view types, refer to the following help topic: [View Types](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Scheduler/Views/View_Types/).

This demo shows multiple calendars side-by-side (with data grouped by resources). For information on how to configure such a display, see the following demos:

- [Resources](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Scheduler/Resources/)
- [Group Orientation](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Scheduler/GroupOrientation/)
