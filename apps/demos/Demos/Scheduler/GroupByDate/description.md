Appointments can be grouped by resources. This demo declares a single resource&mdash;Priority. Refer to the following demo for more information about resources and their configuration: [Resources](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Scheduler/Resources/).

When appointments are grouped by resources, you can additionally group them by date first. To do this, set [groupByDate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#groupByDate) to **true**. You can also use the [same property](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#groupByDate) for individual views. Note that Scheduler groups appointments by date when the view's [groupOrientation](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#groupOrientation) is *"horizontal"* only.

In this demo, you can use the switch below the Scheduler to change the value of **groupByDate**.
