When the [adaptivityEnabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#adaptivityEnabled) property is set to **true**, Scheduler elements adapt to small screens as follows:

* [Cell overflow indicators](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Scheduler/Appointments/Cell_Overflow_Indicator/) become larger to accommodate touch gestures.
* The appointment list **for a chosen date** slides in from the edge of the screen.
* The appointment details form occupies the entire screen.
* Instead of the [view switcher](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Scheduler/View_Switcher/), a drop-down menu is used to switch between views. To open this menu, users should click or tap a button in the upper right corner.

In this demo, we also added the [floating action button](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/FloatingActionButton/Overview/) as an alternative way to create a new appointment. The button is implemented with the [SpeedDialAction](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSpeedDialAction/) component.
