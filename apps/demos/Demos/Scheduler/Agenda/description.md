The Agenda view shows appointments as a simple list. This is the most compact display style because it doesn't render a time scale. Appointments follow each other without empty spaces and their sizes do not depend on event duration.

To add the Agenda view to your Scheduler, declare it in the [views](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/) array.

[note] The Agenda view does not allow a user to add appointments or modify them by dragging.

For more information about Agenda and other supported views, refer to the following help topic: [View Types](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Scheduler/Views/View_Types/).
