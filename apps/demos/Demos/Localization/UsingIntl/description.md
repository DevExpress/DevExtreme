DevExtreme supports localization via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl" target="_blank">Intl API</a>. To apply localization, link or import [dictionaries](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Dictionaries) and set the locale with the **DevExpress.localization.locale()** method. Refer to the [Localization](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/) article for more information on localization properties.
