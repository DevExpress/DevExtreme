Our next major release (v24.2) will include a Chat component, a must-have UI element for apps that require real-time communication support.

We published the DevExtreme v24.2 EAP build with an early preview of this component. For more information, refer to [our blog post](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/javascript/archive/2024/09/19/devextreme-early-access-preview-v24-2.aspx).

Here’s a sneak peek at what you can expect from our Chat component: 

- **Human-to-Human Interaction**\
Enable user conversations with a chat interface for one-on-one or multi-account communication. Ideal for customer support, social networking, and/or internal collaboration.

- **AI and Chatbot Integration**\
Enhance your app’s user experience with AI services and chatbots. Automate responses, deliver immediate support services, and boost engagement with intelligent interactions.

- **Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation**\
Our commitment to accessibility ensures that the Chat component will be fully navigable via keyboard, making it intuitive/usable for everyone.
