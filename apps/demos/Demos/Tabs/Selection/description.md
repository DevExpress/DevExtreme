This demo processes tab selection and uses SelectBox and MultiView components to emulate page content. Both these components are bound to Tabs, and vice versa.

You can use the following properties to configure selection:

- [selectedIndex](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectedIndex)    
The index of the selected item.

- [selectedItem](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectedItem)    
The selected item.

- [selectedItems](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectedItems)     
An array of selected items.

- [selectedItemKeys](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectedItemKeys)     
An array of selected item keys.

- [selectionMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectionMode)     
Specifies whether the component allows users to select only a single item or multiple items.

- [onSelectionChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#onSelectionChanged)     
A function that is executed when a collection item is selected or selection is canceled.
