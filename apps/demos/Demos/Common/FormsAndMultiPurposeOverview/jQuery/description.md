DevExtreme JavaScript Form is an adaptive client-side control available as a jQuery plugin. This control represents a data object as a collection of label-editor pairs, where editors depend on the data type. You can customize the editors, arrange them in columns, groups, or tabs, and add validation to them. DevExtreme also provides other controls, like FilterBuilder, RangeSelector, RadioGroup, which are more specialized. View demos in this section to learn how you can put these controls to use.
