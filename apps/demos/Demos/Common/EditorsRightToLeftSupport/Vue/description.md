DevExtreme ships with a&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;editors that can be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;Vue components. This collection includes TextBox, NumberBox, DateBox, ColorBox, and many other controls. You can use Vue syntax and techniques to&nbsp;instantiate and configure the controls or&nbsp;handle their events. In addition, the&nbsp;components support [prop validation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation) and templates that use [named slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Named-Slots).
