The DevExtreme Editor components support right-to-left (RTL) languages. The components can display content in a right-to-left direction and mirror associated UI elements.

To enable RTL language support in the application, you can either set the [globalConfig](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/globalConfig/) object's [rtlEnabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/globalConfig/#rtlEnabled) property to **true** or specify each component's **rtlEnabled** property individually. Note that individual RTL parameters have higher priority than general parameters.

In this demo, you can use the language drop-down menu (for example, change the language from English to Arabic) to explore the differences between default and RTL modes.
