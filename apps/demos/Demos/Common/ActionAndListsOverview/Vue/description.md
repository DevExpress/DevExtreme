The DevExtreme library includes a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;Vue components used to&nbsp;represent data collections and allow a&nbsp;user to&nbsp;perform various actions on&nbsp;the view. This demo shows the List and Tile View components from this collection. You can use Vue syntax and techniques to&nbsp;instantiate and configure the DevExtreme Vue components or&nbsp;handle their events. In addition, the&nbsp;components support [prop validation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation) and templates that use [named slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Named-Slots).
