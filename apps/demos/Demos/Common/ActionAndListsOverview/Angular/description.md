The DevExtreme library includes multiple controls for representing data collections and performing actions on the view, like List, Lookup, FileUploader, and many others. You can use them as Angular components that support AOT compilation, TypeScript compile-time checking and declarative configuration. This demo shows the List and TileView components. Demos of other components are available in this section.
