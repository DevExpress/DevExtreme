In&nbsp;this demo, the FileUploader component is&nbsp;configured for asynchronous upload. Use the **File types** drop-down menu to&nbsp;select acceptable file types for the **Open file** dialog. The **Upload mode** drop-down menu allows you to&nbsp;specify whether the file is&nbsp;uploaded on&nbsp;a&nbsp;button click or&nbsp;instantly after the file has been selected. In&nbsp;addition, you can specify whether the FileUploader allows multiple file selection.

To&nbsp;select files, click the _Select file_ button or&nbsp;drop the files directly on&nbsp;the component. If&nbsp;the upload mode is _&laquo;useButtons&raquo;_, you must click the _Upload_ button or&nbsp;a&nbsp;corresponding button for each file to&nbsp;initiate upload.

[note]This demo does not actually upload files. To upload files, assign the URL of a page providing server scenarios for saving uploaded files to the **uploadUrl** configuration property of the component.
