The FileUploader component supports the drag-and-drop functionality to upload files.
<!--split-->

In this demo, the [dropZone](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#dropZone) property specifies the HTML element in which you can drag and drop files for upload. The [dropZoneEnter](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#onDropZoneEnter) and [dropZoneLeave](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#onDropZoneLeave) events allow you to customize the drop zone when the mouse pointer enters and leaves this zone while dragging the file.
