This demo shows how to&nbsp;adjust a&nbsp;relative position of&nbsp;the **LinerGauge** elements. The range container, value and subvalue indicators have the **offset** property that specifies a&nbsp;shift from the scale for this element. When this property is&nbsp;assigned to&nbsp;a&nbsp;positive value, the corresponding element moves down from its initial position. Otherwise, it&nbsp;moves&nbsp;up.
