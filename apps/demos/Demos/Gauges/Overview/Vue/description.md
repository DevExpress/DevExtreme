DevExtreme Vue Gauge controls help you visualize data and create dashboards. Our library includes three gauge types: radial bar gauges, circular scale gauges, and linear gauges.

This demo displays a simple dashboard with a few highly customized gauges. 

Review other demos in this section to explore gauge features such as geometry customization, palettes, tooltips, and custom label display.

You can use Vue syntax and techniques to instantiate and configure the gauges or handle their events. In addition, the components support [prop validation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation).

Use our DevExpress BI Dashboard to embed interactive business intelligence into your next web app.

The Web Dashboard is a data analysis UI component that you can embed into your ASP.NET Core or Angular, React, and Vue applications with .NET backend. Dashboards allow you to display multiple inter-connected data analysis elements such as grids, charts, maps, gauges, and others: all within an automatically-arranged layout.

The set of components allows you to deploy an all-in-one solution and switch between Viewer and Designer modes directly on the web client (includes adaptive layouts for tablet & mobile).

The Web Dashboard is available as a part of a Universal subscription.
