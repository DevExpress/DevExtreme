This demo illustrates the Chart's data aggregation feature using the [line](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Chart/Series_Types/Line_Series/), [range area](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Chart/Series_Types/Range_Series/), and [bar](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Chart/Series_Types/Bar_Series/) series. The line series shows temperature changes using average, minimum, or maximum temperature values in the selected time interval. The range area series shows the temperature range for the same time interval and uses a custom aggregate function. The bar series illustrates precipitation and is not aggregated.
