This demo shows a step area [series type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#type). The primary difference between area and step area is that in step area series, data points are connected by perpendicular vertical and horizontal lines.

To create multiple area series, use the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/) array to declare each series and the [commonSeriesSettings](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/) object to specify the common series type. In that object you can implement specific parameters to configure [step area](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Series_Types/StepAreaSeries/) specifically. For example, this demo disables a [border](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Series_Types/StepAreaSeries/border/) for all series.
