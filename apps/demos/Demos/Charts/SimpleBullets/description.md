Bullet charts are useful when you need to compare a single measure to a target value. A bullet bar indicates the measure and a vertical line indicates the target value. The bullet also includes a zero level line that indicates zero on the scale.

## Configure the Bullet Bar

Specify the [value](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/#value) property to set the length of the bullet bar. The value should be between the [startScaleValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/#startScaleValue) and [endScaleValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/#endScaleValue). If you do not specify the scale range, the **startScaleValue** is 0 and the **endScaleValue** is calculated automatically based on measure and target values. 

When you arrange several bullets in a column, set the same scale range for them so that their bullet bars can be compared visually. 

To change the bar color, use the [color](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/#color) property.

## Configure the Target and Zero Level Lines

Set the [target](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/#target) property to specify the target value. You can also use the [targetColor](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/#targetColor) and [targetWidth](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/#targetWidth) properties to customize the target line appearance. 

The zero level line indicates zero and has the same color as the target line. If you want to hide the zero level line, you can disable the [showZeroLevel](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/#showZeroLevel) property.

## Configure the Tooltip

A tooltip contains information about the measure and target values. To configure the tooltip, use the [tooltip](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/tooltip/) object. In this demo, the [customizeTooltip](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBullet/Configuration/tooltip/#customizeTooltip) function within this object customizes the tooltip content.

Use our DevExpress BI Dashboard to embed interactive business intelligence into your next web app.

The Web Dashboard is a data analysis UI component that you can embed into your ASP.NET Core or Angular, React, and Vue applications with .NET backend. Dashboards allow you to display multiple inter-connected data analysis elements such as grids, charts, maps, gauges, and others: all within an automatically-arranged layout.

The set of components allows you to deploy an all-in-one solution and switch between Viewer and Designer modes directly on the web client (includes adaptive layouts for tablet & mobile).

The Web Dashboard is available as a part of a Universal subscription.
