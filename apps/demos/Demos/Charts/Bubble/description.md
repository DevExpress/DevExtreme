This demo illustrates use of&nbsp;the _bubble_ series type. This series can be&nbsp;used when you need to&nbsp;visualize a&nbsp;data set with three dimensions: the first two dimensions are indicated by&nbsp;coordinates on&nbsp;the axes, the third by&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;the bubble. In&nbsp;this demo, the bubble size helps estimate the percentage of&nbsp;people with age over 60&nbsp;to&nbsp;the total population in&nbsp;the country.
