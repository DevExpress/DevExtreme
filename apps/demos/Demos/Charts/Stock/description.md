A stock [series type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#type) displays variations in stock prices over the course of a day. You can specify the stock series type for each object in the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/) or specify the type in the [commonSeriesSettings](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/) object for all series in the Chart. Use the [commonSeriesSettings](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/).[stock](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Series_Types/StockSeries/) object to configure properties of the Chart stock series.

In stock series, the bottom and top values of a vertical line correspond to high and low prices. Use the [highValueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#highValueField) and [lowValueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#lowValueField) properties to specify data source fields for high and low prices.

Open and close prices are displayed as left and right tick marks. To specify these prices, use the [openValueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#openValueField) and [closeValueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#closeValueField) properties.

To reflect changes on the market, the Chart component compares the price of every point with the price of the previous point. The Chart paints the points whose price has decreased in a specific [reduction color](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/reduction/#color). To switch between high, low, open or close prices of points as sources for data comparison, use the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/).[reduction](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/reduction/).[level](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/reduction/#level) property.

Additionally, use the [tooltip](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/tooltip/).[contentTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/tooltip/#contentTemplate) property to declare a custom tooltip that shows prices. You can also enable the [argumentAxis](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/).[workdaysOnly](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/#workdaysOnly) property to display only the work days on the argument axis.
