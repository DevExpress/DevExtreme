Line charts help visualize data and display them as lines with points placed over specified intervals. This demo shows how to initialize and configure Line, Stacked Line, and Full-Stacked Line charts. A Stacked Line chart visualizes multiple data series and allows you to compare the manner in which each series contributes to the total aggregate value for specific arguments. A Full-Stacked Line chart helps compare the percentage value of multiple line series for each argument. Use the drop-down menu under the chart to switch between chart types.

## Bind to Data

You can bind line charts to one of the following data sources: 

* [Local Array](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Specify_a_Data_Source/Local_Array/)
* [JSON Data](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Specify_a_Data_Source/Read-Only_Data_in_JSON_Format/)
* [OData Service](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Specify_a_Data_Source/OData/)
* [Custom Data Source](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Specify_a_Data_Source/Custom_Data_Sources/)

In this demo, the chart is populated with data from a local JavaScript array.

## Configure Series

The series type defines the appearance of your chart. To display a Line, Stacked Line, or Full-Stacked Line series, set the [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/#type) property to one of these types. 

You also need to bind the series to data. Set the [argumentField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#argumentField) and [valueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#valueField) properties to data fields that contain arguments and values for your series. You can specify these properties in an object in the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/) array or include them in the [commonSeriesSettings](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/) object. In this demo, the **argumentField** and **type** properties are specified for all series in the **commonSeriesSettings** object.

## Enable Tooltips

When you hover the mouse pointer over a series point, it shows a tooltip with information about the series point. To display tooltips, you need to enable the [tooltip.enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/tooltip/#enabled) property. 

## Export Chart to Image

To allow a user to print the chart or export it as a PNG, JPEG, or SVG file, set the [export.enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/export/#enabled) property to **true**. This setting adds a button that opens a drop-down menu with export and print commands. In this demo, you can find this button in the upper-right corner.
