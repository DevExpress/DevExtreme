The Chart and PieChart components support different modes of&nbsp;series hovering. This demo shows the _&laquo;includePoints&raquo;_ mode, when all the points of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hovered series change their display style. In&nbsp;addition, you can specify a&nbsp;custom hover mode for legend items. Here, the _&laquo;excludePoints&raquo;_ mode is&nbsp;used, when only the series line changes its display style leaving the points as&nbsp;they were.
