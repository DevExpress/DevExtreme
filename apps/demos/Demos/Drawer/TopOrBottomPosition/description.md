Drawer is a dismissible or permanently visible panel that usually contains navigation elements. 
<!--split-->

To open or close the Drawer component in this demo, click the 'Hamburger' button. Each Drawer visibility change can adjust the layout in the following ways (see [openedStateMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDrawer/Configuration/#openedStateMode)): 

- "*push*"    
The Drawer partially displaces the view.

- "*shrink*"    
The view shrinks to accommodate the Drawer.

- "*overlap*"    
The Drawer overlaps the view.

Use the radio buttons at the bottom of this demo module to try different layout modes. You can also change the Drawer's [position](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDrawer/Configuration/#position) and [revealMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDrawer/Configuration/#revealMode) properties.

Note this demo's markup. The Drawer definition encloses the view content (the formatted text). The Drawer's own content (navigation links) is set by the [template](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDrawer/Configuration/#template) property. Finally, the toolbar markup is separate from other elements.
