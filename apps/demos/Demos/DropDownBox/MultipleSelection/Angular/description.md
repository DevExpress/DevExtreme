If the UI component embedded into the DropDownBox allows multiple selection, synchronize the DropDownBox value with the selected items. [Synchronization instructions](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DropDownBox/SingleSelection/Angular/Light/) are the same for every selection mode.

In this demo, the DataGrid's **selection**.[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#mode) and TreeView's [selectionMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/#selectionMode) properties are used to enable multiple selection.
