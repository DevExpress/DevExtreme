DropDownBox is an advanced editor whose drop-down window can include other components.

DevExtreme ships with multiple other drop-down editors. To find out what editor is suitable for your task, review the following article: [How to Choose a Drop-Down Editor](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Lookup/Choose_a_Drop-Down_Editor/).

If the UI component embedded into the DropDownBox component's drop-down window allows multiple selection, synchronize the component's value with the state of selected items as demonstrated in the following demo: [Single Selection](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DropDownBox/SingleSelection/).

This demo uses the DataGrid's **selection**.[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#mode) and TreeView's [selectionMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/#selectionMode) properties to enable multiple selection.
