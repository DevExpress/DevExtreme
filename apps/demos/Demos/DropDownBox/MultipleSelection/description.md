DropDownBox is an advanced drop-down editor that allows you to embed any content, including other components.

DevExtreme offers multiple drop-down editor options. To find out which editor you should use, review the following article: [How to Choose a Drop-Down Editor](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Lookup/Choose_a_Drop-Down_Editor/).

If the UI component embedded into the DropDownBox allows multiple selection, synchronize the DropDownBox value with the selected items. [Synchronization instructions](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DropDownBox/SingleSelection/) are the same for every selection mode.

In this demo, the DataGrid's **selection**.[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#mode) and TreeView's [selectionMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/#selectionMode) properties are used to enable multiple selection.
