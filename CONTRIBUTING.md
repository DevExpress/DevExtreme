## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Important: **DevExtreme does not offer customer support on GitHub.**

The DevExtreme team uses the [DevExpress Support Center](https://www.devexpress.com/sc) to track bug reports and answer user questions. We monitor GitHub issues, but always give priority to Support Center tickets.

If you own an [active license](https://js.devexpress.com/Licensing/), submit your inquiries to the Support Center website.
