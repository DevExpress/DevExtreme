# Contribution Guidelines

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Important: **DevExtreme does not offer customer support on GitHub.**

The DevExtreme team uses the [DevExpress Support Center](https://www.devexpress.com/sc) to track bug reports and answer user questions. We monitor GitHub issues in an unofficial capacity, but always give priority to Support Center tickets.

If you own an active [commercial](https://js.devexpress.com/Licensing/#Commercial) license, submit your inquiries to the Support Center website.

## Vulnerability disclosure

If you discover a **security issue**, send an [email](mailto:info@devexpress.com) with the description to info@devexpress.com.

## Contributing Code and Content

Important: **Before you submit a contribution, read Section 5 of the [DevExtreme License Agreement](LICENSE.md#5-submission-of-contributions).**

The team decides the product's [development schedule](https://js.devexpress.com/React/Roadmap/) in advance. We may not be able to accept pull requests from unpaid contributors in a timely manner. You are welcome to fork the repository, modify the source code, and create your own builds.

Third party pull requests are subject to the following requirements:

1. The PR needs to contain a detailed description of proposed changes.
